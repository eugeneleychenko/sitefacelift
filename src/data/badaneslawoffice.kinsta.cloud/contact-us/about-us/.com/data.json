David told me the divorce was not filed properly the first time and that we would have to start over. We were told again it would be done in 6 months. His knowledge of the process gave us the comfort that this time it would be handled properly. After 6 months as promised, my divorce was final without issues. We are so pleased to have an attorney who delivered what he promised. David is very competent, and I would recommend him highly to friends or family without hesitation.\",\n        author: \"John\",\n        location: null\n    },\n    {\n        text: \"Mr. Badanes addressed my legal questions in a very clear and efficient manner which greatly facilitated my understanding of the process.
