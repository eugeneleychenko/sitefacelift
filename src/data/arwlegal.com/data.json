  "valueProp": "Let’s face it, jobs can be stressful. Managing your career through the plethora of personalities of your bosses and co-workers, the rules of the company, and your company’s ‘culture,' is not an easy task. A job change--even if initiated by you--can be confusing, surprising, and sometimes devastating. Mental health experts often equate a job loss or major career change to a divorce, where feelings of anger, grief, loss, competency and low self-worth are often evoked.",
