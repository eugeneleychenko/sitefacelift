Gary received his J.D., in 2005 from St. John's University School of Law, where he was a member of the Senior Board of the Moot Court Honor Society. After law school, Gary served as an Assistant District Attorney with the Kings County District Attorney's Office, where he sought justice on behalf of the Kings County community. Thereafter, he briefly represented hospitals and doctors from medical malpractice claims. During his tenure at one of the top medical malpractice firms in New York City, Gary realized that his services were needed by those individuals that did not have the resources to obtain the justice that they deserved. As a result, he decided to dedicate all of his efforts to representing those individuals who were seriously injured due to motor vehicle accidents\u201a construction accidents, medical malpractice, product liability and, to put it simply, the negligent acts of others.",
