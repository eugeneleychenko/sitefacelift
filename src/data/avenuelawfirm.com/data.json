    "valueProp": "When searching for a home, many people think of hiring only a real estate agent. While people in this profession can greatly help with your housing search or sale, they aren\u2019t the only experts you want on your team. The buying and selling of homes is a serious legal transaction, and it is easy to get stuck in a bad contract or pay more in a mortgage than you need to. Additionally, local laws can make real estate transactions complicated, and agents don\u2019t always know the intricacies of the laws. This is why having a real estate law firm on your side is a good idea.",
