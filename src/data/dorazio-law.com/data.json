    "valueProp": "Bernard D'Orazio & Associates, P.C., is an established New York City-based law firm focused on large value commercial debt collection and judgment enforcement matters. Our practice extends throughout New York State and in the Federal courts. The firm is led by New York attorney Bernard D'Orazio, who is AV\u00ae rated as \"Preeminent\" in Litigation and Collections by Martindale-Hubbell.\n\nOperating since 1991, our law firm has vast experience representing an array of creditors, including businesses, banks and other lenders, landlords, in cases involving commercial litigation, debt collection, and the enforcement of the rights of creditors. We assist attorneys in New York, from other states, and from other countries, enforce and collect upon money judgments.\n\nWe are renowned for our New York judgment enforcement practice, especially fraudulent conveyance actions and proceedings filed under New York's Debtor and Creditor Law, Article 10. A fraudulent conveyance is a transfer of property by a debtor, usually without \"fair consideration\" and with actual or constructive intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor. It is illegal for debtors to transfer property to avoid paying their creditors or to try to make themselves \"judgment proof.\" A court may, on a creditor's application, invalidate a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer of assets and award other appropriate relief, including attorneys' fees.\n\nWe operate our New York judgment enforcement and commercial debt collection practice from our magnificent \"uptown\" headquarters on two floors of a New York City landmark townhouse and from our long-time \"downtown\" office on Lafayette Street in lower Manhattan, where we maintain our war room.",
