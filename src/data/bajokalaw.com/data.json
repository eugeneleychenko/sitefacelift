My clients have included everyone from those accused of being associated with organized crime to doctors and other healthcare professionals, to those accused of public corruption at the highest levels. Some of my cases have been high profile, garnering local, national, and even international attention. I have fought and won criminal and immigration cases at the highest state and federal levels. I put my all into every case and I never give up. When you hire me, you hire a friend, a defender, and a fighter who has the courage to stand up for your rights.",
