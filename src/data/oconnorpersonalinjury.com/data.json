  "valueProp": "In today's world, it's hard to get a fair shake from the people who've caused you harm. Reckless drivers, careless doctors, negligent landlords, irresponsible pet owners, and so on, when they fail to behave reasonably, they can produce real hardship in your life. Even more frustrating, the insurance companies that are sometimes liable for these damages rarely step up to the plate on their own. If you've recently been injured (or suffered losses) because of someone else's negligence, you might be having a hard time getting the money you're owed. Or, even if an insurer has offered you compensation, there's a good chance it's for a lot less than you deserve. An experienced Kingston personal injury attorney can fight to change all that.",
