  "valueProp": "Dawson & Rosenthal, P.C., is led by Steven C. Dawson and Anita Rosenthal, attorneys whose comfort in trial proceedings have helped individuals throughout Arizona and San Diego in challenging insurance bad faith cases. We view insurance bad faith representation as an opportunity to hold companies accountable for corporate policies that are designed to save the company money at the expense of the policyholder. People who file claims are going up against insurance companies that have vast legal and financial resources to protect their best interests, making them vulnerable as the underdogs in a claim, at a time when they need help the most. We aim to level the playing field, restore balance and help our clients recover the compensation their policies entitle them to.",
