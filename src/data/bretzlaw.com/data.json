  "valueProp": "Our team of dedicated attorneys at Bretz & Coven, LLP are known throughout the United States and in particular, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for enthusiastically taking on the cases that other lawyers turn down. When we believe an injustice is being done, we are prepared to fight for our clients all the way to the federal courts, and we have the record to prove it. Our firm is rated Preeminent\u2122 by Martindale-Hubbell\u00ae (the highest peer-review rating for both ethics and knowledge), as well as listed in Super Lawyers and Best Lawyers in the U.S.  Our team includes a former Trial Attorney for the Legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), U.S. Department of Justice. Because of our reputation in immigration law and deportation/removal defense, other immigration and criminal defense attorneys often refer difficult cases to us.  We love to strategize cases involving complex fact patterns, the immigration consequences of alleged criminal conduct and fraud, as well as those seeking to live here legally based upon family, employment, talent, education and profession. Those non-citizens who have a fear of persecution if returned to their native countries can feel at ease with our experience in political asylum, withholding of removal and the Convention Against Torture (CAT).  Minors who have been abused, neglected or abandoned can rely on our record of working both the family and immigration courts to secure a green card. Our staff speak more than 15 languages and we have three offices:  \nNew York City, Bronx and Clark, New Jersey.  We offer in person, Zoom and telephonic consultations.",
