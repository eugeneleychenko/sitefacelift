# Michael Zigismund

## At the Law Offices of Robert Tsigler, Michael Zigismund is an integral
member of both the criminal defense and immigration teams.

For the firm’s criminal defense department, Mr. Zigismund handles a wide
variety of matters at both the state and federal levels. He has represented
clients facing charges such as Murder, Assault, Strangulation, Hit-and-run,
Criminal contempt, Criminal possession of a weapon, Criminal sale of a
firearm, Major drug trafficking, Criminal sale of a controlled substance,
Criminal possession of a controlled substance, Sex trafficking, Prostitution,
Rape, Forcible touching, Unlawful dissemination of an intimate image, Robbery,
Grand larceny, Burglary, Identity theft, Forged Instruments, Wire fraud, DWI,
Illegal reentry, Violation of Probation, Bail jumping, and many more.

Mr. Zigismund’s unique expertise in immigration consequences for criminal
defendants is indispensable for clients who are simultaneously struggling with
both immigration and criminal issues.

For the firm’s immigration department, Mr. Zigismund directs all cases. As an
immigrant himself, Mr. Zigismund personally understands the hardships facing
anyone caught in America’s immigration system. His cases include removal
defense, applications before USCIS, Department of State, ICE, and CBP, and
appeals before the BIA and Circuit Courts of Appeals.

Mr. Zigismund likewise advises on immigration and criminal matters for the
firm’s other departments, including for clients in the family law department.

Practicing in over 50 jurisdictions, Mr. Zigismund often works on post-
conviction relief, clemency, record sealing, SORA (sex offender registry)
modification, subpoenas, out-of-court settlements for criminal activity,
victim representation, extradition, and government investigation with such
agencies as NYPD, ACS, New York Board of Education, New York Department of
Health, Connecticut Department of Social Services, DMV, New York Department of
Labor, Special Victims Units (SVU), Chase Bank, Bank of America, USCIS, FBI,
ICE, CBP, Homeland Security Investigations, Department of State, Department of
Agriculture, and the USPS.

Before joining Tsigler Law, Mr. Zigismund practiced a wide range of fields,
including corporate transactions, tort and contract litigation, bankruptcy,
insurance, and landlord-tenant, among others. As such, he carries a legal
sensibility few other lawyers possess. His broad base of knowledge,
experience, and singular passion for criminal justice and immigration, atop
his significant experience in both, are key to Mr. Zigismund’s success when
fighting for the rights of his clients.

Admissions to practice law include New York State, the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the Southern District of New
York, and the Eastern District of New York.

Mr. Zigismund received his J.D. from the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law,
where he trained intensively with the school’s Criminal Appeals Clinic, and
his B.A. from Tufts University, where he graduated magna cum laude.
