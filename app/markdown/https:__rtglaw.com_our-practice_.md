# Our Practice

**Whether a Fortune 100 Corporation, small start-up or individual, we work
closely with our clients to fashion solutions for their problems.** Our legal
skill, experience, and creativity provide clients a wide range of strategic
options, including taking cases to trial when that is the optimal solution. We
understand that no client wants the solution to cost more than the problem, we
make sure that does not happen. We assess our clientsâ€™ problems early and
design a strategy and billing method that helps our clients obtain their
objective within budget.
