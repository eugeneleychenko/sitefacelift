## Legal Services for Employers

Running a business, practice, or nonprofit is challenging. Even when day-to-
day operations are running smoothly, responsibilities like recruiting new
employees and managing current staff, seeking new clients, staying compliant
with local, state, and federal employment laws, and more, are anything but
routine.
