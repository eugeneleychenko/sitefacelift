# San Jose Estate Planning Lawyer

## Protecting Your Heirs ∙ Following Your Wishes

An estate plan is not set in cement. Although it indicates your permanent wishes, it is more like a perennial garden. Some plants outgrow their spots and must be pruned. Some do not thrive where they are planted and must be moved. Others simply die.

Your estate plan should be revisited to make certain it still accomplishes what you intend it to.

  * Is your spouse protected?
  * Are your heirs protected from their creditors?
  * Is their inheritance protected if your adult children divorce?
  * Have you made the best decisions to minimize taxes?
  * Does your estate plan avoid probate?



I am Robert A. Froehlich — a San Jose estate planning attorney with more than 30 years of experience. Because estate planning is all that I do, I am up to date on all the latest tax law changes, and have developed a number of estate planning strategies to help people accomplish their goals.

Living trusts that were executed in the past may no longer work. Tax laws have changed, and new ones will go into effect soon.  
Contact estate planning lawyer and tax attorney Robert Froehlich at (408) 364-1234​ to get your living trust or will up to date.

## Santa Clara County Living Trust Lawyer

There have been significant changes to our California economy and to our lifestyle since many estate plans were prepared. In the past, if a mother and father died, the children inherited the estate. Today, children may lose their inheritance to their creditors. For those with more than $100,000 in assets (a bar easily met for any homeowner) probate may tie up an inheritance for a significant period of time if adequate provisions have not been made.

A living trust is a way to protect inheritance and avoid probate. Clients that have an existing living trust should have it re-examined to take advantage of current tax laws and to provide creditor protection for the heirs. A simple amendment to your current living trust may be all that is needed.
