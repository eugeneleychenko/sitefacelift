> I was recommended to Michael to help me set up a new corporation I was starting. The advice he gave me was great, and I eventually hired his services to create the agreements and contracts between myself and my business partner. Throughout the process he guided me and asked very detailed questions. I felt that he had my back and my best interest at heart. Looking back now, the contracts he wrote have saved me close to $40,000 in money that I would have otherwise had to pay. Thank you Michael. Everyone should follow your standards.

**Jason Delfos** , Marketing and Advertising Design Group, LLC

> We hired San Diego Corporate Law to help us establish our business in San Diego. In the initial stages of setting up our business and transitioning to California, we were frequently out of town.

I would not hesitate to recommend San Diego Corporate Law to another business owner.

His work was very diligent and completed exactly by the deadline promised. Michael and San Diego Corporate Law hold my highest recommendation!

**Anton Ivanov** , Dreams Cash True

  


> Michael J. Leonard helped me configure my business entities into a solid investment vehicle. He is very professional, knowledgeable, easy to reach and timely. San Diego Corporate Law produced a unique and informative Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) for my business for less than half the cost other law firms were charging. I expect to use the PPM and San Diego Corporate Law for many years. I recommend Michael because of his efficient, hands on, practical approach to legal work in a time of dramatic changes with securities laws (JOBS Act).

**John Copyak** , Clean USA Power, Inc.

  
  


> Michael J. Leonard at San Diego Corporate Law not only helped us establish our small business in San Diego, but he helped us to solidify our partnership to avoid any gray areas as we are a family-run business.

Michael and his team have always delivered not only an extremely high level of service, but also have been so patient through the whole process of setting up our LLC. Whenever I have questions or need their service, they are very easy to communicate with and very reasonably priced. I will not only use them for any legal advice that I may need in the future, but also refer all the people that may also need their services.
