# About You

In much of Corporate America, the selection of outside litigation counsel is
premised upon considerations of career preservation - specifically, the fear
of being second-guessed for not hiring The Big Firm, regardless of the size or
complexity of the matter. _Claims_ magazine reports that such a "strategy"
likely results in millions of client dollars in unnecessary legal expense
being wasted every year. Not smart. (Old French proverb: "The houses of
lawyers are built on the heads of fools.")

Challenge your assumptions. Bigger is not necessarily better on all matters.
In certain cases, we can help you substantially reduce your legal spending
with no dropoff in quality. And whenever you call us, you'll talk directly
with an experienced lawyer who can actually solve your problems. Our track
record is outstanding. We're AV-rated®, and we specialize in commercial
litigation, insurance law (policyholders only, no carriers) and employment
law.

We call this section "About You" and not "About Us" for a reason.
