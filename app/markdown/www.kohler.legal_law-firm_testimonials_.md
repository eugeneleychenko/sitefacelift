"Kohler Legal was nothing short of amazing. They helped me set up my LLC for my new consulting business, Dylan Caden Group, and I was impressed with their attention to detail and in depth level of knowledge. They were also always available to me for even the most mundane questions. I would strongly recommend them." **- Andy B**.

"We have to say choosing Kohler Legal to help with the legal practice of our company is the best decision we ever made. Words cannot describe how incredibly satisfied we are with their work. Jordan is so nice and friendly, he always gives proper business solutions as well as legal advice tailored to the nature of our company. Kohler Legal is affordable and has given me satisfactory work time and time again." **- Michael B**.

"Jordan simply does great work! He makes the whole process easy, transparent and educational. 100% recommended." **- Steven M**.

"Kohler Legal not only assisted us with the proper formation of our LLC, but wrote numerous documents required for our app that was published shortly thereafter. His legal review and advice with regards to hosting the app, as well as his filing process for the various trademarks, gave us the confidence that we were on a solid track free of any cracks that might bite us down the road." **- Peter J**.

"Jordan is very professional and efficient. He helped me file two trademark applications for my S-Corp and made the process simple and straightforward. He answered questions, explained the process, and gave sound advice - all of which were greatly appreciated. I am happy to have him as legal counsel for my business." **- Peyton T**.

"Jordan is one of the most knowledgable, ethical, and honest people I've ever had the privilege to work with. After several failed attempts to find an honest trademark attorney I stumbled upon Jordan from his previous reviews on yelp, hoping it was worth a try. As a small start up company, Jordan's background as an entrepreneur made our communication very relatable. He worked with us on the pricing and gave me all the options necessary to make his services as feasible as possible. " **- Sina O**.

"Jordan was great to work with! He helped our manufacturing company with several legal documents. We like his "plain English" approach to legal matters. He can take a very complicated legal matter and break it down into easy to understand pieces. We will definitely use his services again!" **- Alicia E**.

"Jordan set up my California LLC two years ago and then recently converted it to a Florida LLC. He is easy to work with and communicates clearly. He completed the work on time and his fees were reasonable. Could ask for any more." **- Jeff L**.

"After retaining an attorney who was more than happy to take my money and never answer my phone calls or email I reached out to Jordan and it was a blessing in disguise. Jordan helped me through a pretty difficult, and complex situation involving my business and I'm extremely grateful for his keen awareness. Very attentive to my needs and gave great advice. Always responded quickly to email and phone calls. If you're looking for an attorney who will look out for your best interest and treat you like a valued client then give Jordan a call." **- Jeffery H**.

"Jordan wrote a business contract I needed. He was helpful, met deadlines, had good communication, and provided fast followup for revisions. I recommend and will use his services again." **- Nick B**.

"I would recommend Kohler Legal to any (upcoming tech) company. Jordan is rational, and this saves time which saves tons of money when drafting deals. He is friendly, respects clients, willing to be involved, and is experienced, having provided legal advice for startup companies. He used his expertise to estimate my firm’s risks, offer tailored solutions and clinch deals on time, at very affordable costs. Our firm could not get to where it is today were it not for Kohler’s dedication toward our goals." **- Hayden C**.

"We have had Jordan do two separate trademark applications for our businesses. He has always been very attentive and makes things easy to understand. I don't feel like he is speaking to me in another language that I don't understand which is how I usually feel when speaking to attorneys or lawyers. His fees are reasonable and he gets the job done right the first time. We are very happy with his services." **- Sarah D**.

"Definitely a great and dependable firm. Jordan definitely does everything he can to make sure all your legal needs are met and all your questions are answered. I highly recommend this firm!" **- Kenneth R**.

"Jordan took the time to speak with me on two separate occasions when I had legal questions regarding my small business. He was very knowledgeable and professional and provided me with very helpful information. I did not feel pressured to spend a large amount of money, which is what I would have expected. I will definitely be taking all my legal service needs to him in the future!" **- Andrea D**.

"Very good lawyer, very skillful, but more importantly very honest, helpful and friendly. 10/10." **- Jon D**.

"Jordan was a game-changer for our intellectual property paralegal freelance business. Jordan has superb talent and skills not in just business development, he understood our vision and the business acumen, worked well within our budget and time frame, and kept us in the loop throughout the entire process. We could not have asked for a better result as we have received great comments from other professionals regarding the business. We highly recommend Jordan to companies of any size and scope. If you are looking for help with your business or establishing a web presence, I'd highly recommend contacting him." **- Kethya T**.
