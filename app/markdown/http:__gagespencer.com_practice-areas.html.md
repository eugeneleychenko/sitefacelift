We devote a significant portion of our practice to litigation on behalf of
both institutional plaintiffs and defendants in the federal and state courts
and before arbitration panels. Gage Spencer & Fleming believes successful
representation in such complicated cases requires thorough familiarity and
experience in a number of key areas. We understand the intricacies of
securities, merger and acquisition, antitrust, media and intellectual
property, and corporate employment matters. Representative plaintiffs have
included:

  * A _Fortune_ 500 multinational media company, in both the prosecution and defense of multiple actions brought over a span of more than a decade for claims involving fraud, breach of contract, preliminary agreements to agree, breach of fiduciary duty, and alter ego claims, among many others. 
  * One of the world's 10 largest hedge funds, in a sizable commercial dispute with a major bank over the liquidation of trading positions.
  * A leading consumer products company, in the prosecution of a competitor for tortious interference with contract and business relations.
  * A national sports league, in multiple disputes over the years, primarily focused on claims involving licensing and contract issues.
  * A multinational beverage company, in connection with claims of racketeering, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty arising from various investments.
  * A major financial services and communications corporation, in an action arising from the theft of corporate information relating to a tender offer.
  * A bankruptcy court-approved liquidating trust, formed out of the failure of a renowned insurance holding company, in an action against a Big Four accounting firm for audit and actuarial fraud.
  * An executrix of a major artist's estate, in an action for RICO, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and related claims proceedings.
