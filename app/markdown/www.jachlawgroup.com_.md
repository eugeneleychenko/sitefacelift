Came in as a walk in at JP&E, Attorneys at Law and met with Attorney for my consultation, I was very satisfied with the consultation and he answered all of my questions, hes very knowledgeable and very straight forward. I was very fortunate that he was available when I did a walk in. Overall, I would definitely recommend Attorney to anyone looking for great results.

I reached out to Albie for a false criminal case my Ex slapped on me. Albie was very prompt in responding back with his findings on the case and also gave right advice. When I checked with him if I can counter sue for defamation he again provided best advice along with loopholes in the system that my Ex can use to defend. Hence overall I found him a great lawyer who is not behind minting money.
