Contact##   Employment law. About people. For people.      At Layton Law Firm, we practice Employment Law for Northern California's Bay Area businesses--making sure the human element remains integral to everything we do for you. The size of your business doesn't matter. What matters is the core: the individuals who make your business happen. We like working with people who enjoy their work and respect their employees.     The task can be as predictable as reviewing your new employee handbook. You could have an emergent situation that suddenly demands finesse in handling a disgruntled former employee. In some circumstances, you might be required to defend a case in litigation. Wherever you find yourself, Layton Law Firm meets you there.      When you work with us, we always maintain a focus on the most important aspect of all this: protecting you and your business. We speak judiciously and with tact. We do everything possible to mitigate fear. We keep confidences.      Many commonplace legal challenges in business and human resources simply require the eye of a skilled professional who understands the law. We handle such challenges as a matter of routine. Other cases can feel earth shaking and life changing. In those instances, we do everything possible to make it feel less so.     In all circumstances, we remember who and what are most important. And we treat your case accordingly.      **Layton Law Firm. Business.
