## What Our Clients Say

## Suggestions for Hiring a San Diego Corporate Attorney:

#### When to Hire

The best time to hire a business attorney is in the planning stages of starting your business, but it is better late than never. Hiring the right business attorney at such an early stage will help you:

##### Do it Right the First Time.

Setting up a business is complex, especially for first-time business owners. Hiring an attorney experienced in setting up businesses will give you the confidence of knowing you are making the best decisions for your business and that you have not forgotten a step along the way.

##### Save Time and Effort.

Your time is never more valuable than during the organizational stage of a business startup. Hiring an attorney to take care of all the necessary filings will save you hundreds of hours of online research and reading “how to” books on starting a new business, allowing you to focus your attention on the details of the products or services of your new business.

##### Start Making Money Faster.

The organizational stage of starting a business costs money, and this money is not recovered until your doors open and your products or services start selling. Doing everything right the first time, and saving time and effort with the help of an experienced attorney, will get your business through the organizational stage and into operations faster than going at it alone, giving you the chance to start making money with your business sooner rather than later.

#### A Little or a Lot Later

The old adage that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” applies to how a business is started. Being smart about how a business is initially set up may prevent much larger expenses later.

##### Protection from Partners.

An informal relationship among business partners poses a significant risk to the business. While there is a cost involved in establishing business relationships in contracts enforceable in a court of law, this expense is small compared to the cost of litigating a business dispute with a partner.

##### Protection from Workers.

Employees and independent contractors are also a threat to the success of a business. Well-defined rules for workers may be established in handbooks and contracts written in compliance with both federal and state employment laws. These documents make it more difficult for a worker to sue you for wrongful termination or other claims.

##### Protection of Personal Assets.

There is no substitute for good business insurance; however, not all risks are insurable. While no liability limitation is perfect, if a source of liability should arise outside the scope of or in excess of insurance coverage, having a limited liability business entity in place may separate an owner’s personal assets from the assets of the business, insulating the owner of the business from the severe financial hit of an uninsured liability or judgment.

#### Attorney v. Online

Some business owners recognize the need for legal documents and assistance, but think they can replace the services of an attorney (and save a little money) by using non-attorney websites. However:

##### Continuing Service.

Online document preparation sites will not provide the personalized service and support of an attorney. If calling an “800” number and talking to someone in “customer service” with no legal experience is not your idea of legal services, insist upon the expertise of an experienced business attorney.

##### One Size Does NOT Fit All.

The needs of each business and each business owner are unique. No two businesses, even in the same industry, are identical. Generic legal documents written to apply to every industry may not be ideal for a specific instance. Documents relied upon for securing legal rights and establishing liability limitations are best drafted by a seasoned attorney with proven experience.

##### Cost vs. Value.

There is no denying that generic legal documents will cost less than attorney drafted documents. In some cases, significantly less. The only question is, are the generic documents worth the price being charged for them? Spending money on something that is incomplete or legally ineffectual is a waste of money. When it is time to rely upon a document, whether in court, with investors, or in front of clients, there is no substitute for attorney-drafted documents.
