## Frequently Asked Questions

#### In what areas does the firm specialize?

The majority of our services fall under the category of transactional
entertainment work, which includes the negotiation and preparation of
agreements on behalf of entertainment clients. The areas in which we represent
the largest number of clients include theatrical writers, directors,
choreographers, designers, conductors, orchestrators, arrangers, actors and
producers (commercial and not-for-profit). We also represent prominent film
score composers and recording artists, music publishers, film and television
producers and book authors.

#### Do you find work for your clients?

We are not licensed to seek employment for clients, nor do we regularly
attempt to further the development of the projects we represent, which is not
to say that our services never lead to those results. Since we are known for
representing many artists who work in a specific area, we are asked frequently
to recommend clients for collaborations or specific assignments and happily do
so.

#### Do you charge an hourly rate or a percentage?

Generally speaking, hourly when services are not specifically related to an
agreement which results in compensation (e.g. copyright advice) and by
percentage based on a client's gross income with respect to other matters. In
connection with our film and theatre production counsel services, we work on a
flat fee basis.  
  
  
  
  
  

#### Does your firm handle other legal matters?

Yes. We render general legal services including preparation of wills,
corporate matters, leases, copyright and trademark matters. We also work with
a variety of specialists in areas where we deem it in the client's best
interests to involve outside counsel. We do not represent clients in
adversarial proceedings.

#### Do you require a retainer?

A client who is being billed hourly will be asked for a retainer when the firm
is initially engaged. The amount of the retainer will be determined after the
initial consultation and will be based on the attorney's estimate of the cost
of the initial work being requested. The amount of the retainer will be deemed
an advance against hourly charges and is in most cases refundable to the
extent it exceeds the actual cost of the services. Billing thereafter will be
on a monthly basis.
