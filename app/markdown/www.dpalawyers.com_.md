## Is a Business Lawyer Necessary?

Entrepreneurs often question the need for an attorney when starting a new business – and business owners often wonder why one is necessary if they already have in-house counsel. In both circumstances, an established business attorney can be invaluable as a resource for your company.

  * In a startup, an attorney can help draft and revise all the paperwork necessary to register your business, incorporate your startup, and get your policies in place. Additionally, an attorney can provide valuable insight on business decisions, as they have accumulated experience representing a wide variety of businesses in different industries and circumstances.
  * In an established business, an attorney can help supplement the legal tasks of your in-house counsel. An outside business attorney may be able to help with the day-to-day, regular operations of the business so that your in-house counsel can focus on litigating more specialized matters.



Regardless of the size of your company, an attorney can be invaluable to your operations.

### How We Can Help

At DPA Law PC, we provide all the legal assistance necessary to help your business succeed. **We help businesses by:**

  * Organizing corporations and limited liability companies
  * Providing strategic support to start-ups in venture capital and angel financings
  * Supporting our client's day-to-day contract and general counsel needs
  * Representing buyers and sellers in the purchase and sales of businesses and merger and asset sale transactions
  * Providing contract support through negotiating and drafting hosted software and SaaS agreements, professional services agreements, partnering contracts, and distribution and intellectual property transfer agreements.



Our goal is to deliver our attorneys’ large firm expertise on a more personal scale and at a more client-friendly price-point from our offices in San Jose's Willow Glen business district.

### We Can Assist All Companies, Regardless of Industry or Size

Our clients include self-funded start-ups, angel and venture backed technology companies, privately held “brick and mortar” businesses, angel investors, and off-shore investors and corporations with—or seeking—a corporate presence in Silicon Valley, Delaware or Nevada.

### We Are Here to Fight for You If Necessary

On a select basis we represent clients in mediation, arbitration and litigation in California state and federal courts. This is particularly the case in matters of contract disputes between businesses, partnership and stockholder disputes, alleged trade secret misappropriation arising out of employee mobility or perceived unfair competition by former employees or partners.

Additionally, in matters of intellectual property theft or violation, we can help resolve any disputes through litigation that is aggressive but fair.

### Contact Us Today

If you or your business partners have any questions or concerns regarding your company, please contact DPA Law PC immediately for a free initial consultation. For more than 20 years, we have provided comprehensive business counsel for privately held companies in San Jose and greater California.
