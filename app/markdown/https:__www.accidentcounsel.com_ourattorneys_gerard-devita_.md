![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20200%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://accidentcounsel.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/08/LawyerDevita.jpg)Gerard DeVita is a seasoned trial
lawyer in the field of personal injury litigation, and the Managing Attorney
for the negligence department of the firm. His undergraduate degree is from
SUNY College at Oneonta. He earned his Juris Doctor here in Suffolk County at
Touro College School of Law in 1987.

Gerard -- "Jerry" to friends and clients -- has been with the Sarisohn firm
for almost two decades, starting as a clerk while still in law school. Since
1986, he has helped guide many clients through the often complicated and
daunting process of their injury claims. During his time here, our clients
have come to rely on him, as well as the whole team in our Personal
Injury/Negligence department, to assure that fair compensation is recovered
for their losses. Jerry has successfully fought for and recovered millions in
awards for those injured by car accidents, faulty machinery, falls,
construction site accidents, and medical malpractice.

In addition to his duties here at the firm, Jerry is a member of the Suffolk
Bar Association, American Trial Lawyers Association, and also participated in
the Trial Lawyers Care program that assisted victims of the September 11
attacks on the World Trade Center.

After nearly 20 years, he says with enthusiasm: "I still get a rush of
satisfaction and accomplishment when going up against the insurance carriers
to assure a better future for a client who has placed their trust in us."

Jerry and wife Dellanor reside in Medford. Both enjoy outdoor activities like
skiing, biking and hiking.
