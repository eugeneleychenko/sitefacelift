I have great respect for Michael Jaffe (no relation). Insightful, articulate,
professional, Mr. Jaffe never fails to respond, and his response is never off-
point nor overbearing. On several occasions, I have used Mr. Jaffe as a
resource for finding answers to questions on novel legal issues. It is no
wonder why he is so well regarded by the bench and bar.

Richard Jaffe

Great attorneys. One of the most experienced law firms I have had to pleasure
of working with.

Mauricio Vides

Best lawyers when you need the best!

Robin Lipton Guttman

Eugene Gozenput is absolutely one of the best attorneys out there. He
dedicated his time and showed an amazing work ethic. He was able to get me the
maximum amount on my settlement by preparing my case for trial. The entire
team from Mike Jaffe to all the other lawyers were top notch and were
extremely professional. I could not ask for better attorneys.

Freddy Herrera

Best attorneys in the tri-state no case is too big or too small. They will get
you the best results.

Manny Stines

One of the top attorneys in the field.

Managing Partner

From day one Eugene Gozenput from Pazer,Epstein Jaffe and Fein made me feel
very comfortable and gave me piece of mind that I made the right choice in a
law firm. He made me feel like part of his family and got me the best result i
could wish for. Highly recommend this firm!

Kyle Zeman

My personal injury case from my accident was handled with care, and fight to
get me the compensation I need for my catastrophic injuries. This firm is
amazing, Michael Jaffe and Matthew Fein treated my children and I like family
and I would only recommend this firm for someone who was injured in an
accident

Ann Rolston

Even the most difficult case had a positive conclusion with the tireless work
of Michael Jaffe Esq. Highly recommended.

Robin Guttman

This is the best group of attorneys in the NYC area. They helped me get a
settlement in my personal injury lawsuit a few years ago. I have since
referred them several of my friends And family that have had personal injury
cases. Highly recommend this law firm.

Eric Gozenput

I was involved in an bus accident in New York City where I suffered severe
back and neck injuries. I was referred to Mr. Gozenput for legal advice, and
after taking my case pro bono he was able to get me a settlement extremely
quickly. Thank you very much Eugene and I will be sure to refer you any family
or friends that may need your services.

Eric

Eugene Gozenput and Michael Jaffe worked tirelessly to ensure that I was
compensated after being injured. I am appreciative of their support and
dedication.

Anni Kluger

Eugene Gozenput is absolutely the best! Excellent experience highly
recommended this firm!

Richard Hannon

Eugene Gozenput has been my lawyer for the past 5 years. Since day one when I
came into the office hurt and in pain with crutches and a leg brace, he’s been
by my side. I can honestly say his uplifting words and support through the
years is what helped me through my dark times. He killed it when my case went
to trial and we WON! I am so grateful and cannot express how much it means to
me to be able to go back to living my life and moving forward in a positive
direct after suffering from so much pain. Thank you Eugene!

Patricia Lopez

Matthew Fein is my attorney and he is very good at his profession. Tells you
the way it is and always reminds you that he works for you.

Richard Ulysses
