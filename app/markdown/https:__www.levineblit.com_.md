injury, harassment, discrimination, or something else, or if you need legal
advice from a trusted source, you can count on the team at Levine & Blit. We
strive to be the very best advocates for our clients and get them the best
possible outcome for their situation. When you need someone on your side to
ensure you get the justice and compensation you deserve, we are here for you.

One area of law that we specialize in is employment law. Employees in New York
go to work every day and put in their best effort in the hope that they will
be rewarded for their hard work and commitment. Unfortunately, far from
rewarding employees for their efforts, many employers tend to cheat them out
of their hard-earned wages and blatantly violate their rights.

At Levine & Blit, we believe that such unscrupulous employers must be held
accountable for their unlawful and unconscionable actions and made to pay for
their violations. Every day, our New York City employment lawyers fight for
the rights of employees who are unfairly treated or taken advantage of by
their employers.

## Get the Most Trusted Legal Team on Your Side

We are a team of highly rated and competent attorneys who have more than 100
years of combined experience in handling cases related to employment law
violations, sexually transmitted diseases, real estate, and personal injuries.

Clients trust our New York City employment lawyers to handle even the most
complex cases – ranging from wage and hour violation claims to racial
discrimination, disability discrimination, sexual harassment, leave
violations, retaliation, wrongful termination, and many more. We can also
diligently review your employment and severance agreements and make sure your
rights and interests are not violated.

Over the years, our New York City employment lawyers have represented
thousands of clients from diverse backgrounds – including blue-collar workers
and A-list celebrities. Similarly, we have taken on employers of all sizes as
well – from small businesses to multinational corporations – and recovered
millions in lost wages and compensatory damages for our clients.

## A Formidable Reputation and a Winning Track Record

Our talented team of New York City employment lawyers has an outstanding
reputation and a track record of winning cases that other lawyers might think
twice about accepting. Many of our lawyers are members of exclusive forums
like the Multi-Million Dollar Advocates Forum, Top 100 Trial Lawyers, Super
Lawyers, and more.

Owing to their unparalleled legal knowledge, experience, and reputation, the
lawyers at Levine & Blit are often called upon by news outlets to comment on
important legal issues. Some of our lawyers have been profiled and quoted by
leading news outlets and magazines like Reuters, New York Post, ABC7, Daily
News, and Forbes.

## The Law is in Your Favor

The most important thing you need to know as an employee is that the law is in
your favor. New York’s Human Rights Law provides you with an exceptionally
wide range of rights and privileges, many of which are not available to
employees in other states. It also protects your rights at the workplace to a
larger extent than federal employment laws.

Most importantly, New York’s Human Rights Law offers the same level of
protection to employees and non-employees alike. Meaning, whether you are an
independent contractor, sub-contractor, gig worker, temporary worker,
consultant, or vendor, you have the same rights as an employee under the law.
