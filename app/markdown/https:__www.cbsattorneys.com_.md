MEET OUR ATTORNEYS

Calhoun, Bhella & Sechrest, LLP is a boutique law firm made up of a national
team of lawyers trained in some of the biggest firms in the country.  We
counsel with a cutting-edge approach to legal matters by incorporating wisdom
earned through experience with fresh ideas and different perspectives from a
broad range of backgrounds and legal expertise. Tempered together, this
approach has become the cornerstone of what sets us apart from others.  
  
It is through this uncommon counsel that we are able to achieve the best
possible results for our clients, whether it is handling "bet the company"
cases in high-stakes litigation, counseling a client through a multi-billion
dollar transaction, or navigating regulatory hurdles to expand or save the
business. We are proud of our attorneys' many achievements across a variety of
practices and industries, and most importantly, proud of the results we have
helped our clients to achieve.
