# About the Firm

Home » About the Firm

## People Come First

Floyd and Bernard ("Budd") Sarisohn founded **Carner & DeVita** nearly half a
century ago. Although our firm has grown in size over the years, we take pride
in having personal relationships with our clients. Since 1957, we have
embraced a simply philosophy…to work for our clients the way we would care for
a favorite relative or friend. From accidents to arrests, from divorce to real
estate, from negligence to Wills and Estates, when you hire an attorney at our
firm, you are hiring our entire team of seasoned professionals.  

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20300'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://accidentcounsel.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/08/scale.jpg)We are dedicated to responsive service -
making certain that we are always fully prepared to meet the needs of each
client. In addition, we are committed to working diligently in the best
interests of every client we represent. Perhaps that explains why many of our
clients have looked to us for legal advice for decades, and have counted on us
to be their advocate again and again. After all, in any business, the truest
measure of satisfaction is repeat business.

The attorneys at Carner & DeVita, many of whom are recognized leaders in their
respective legal fields, have developed well-earned reputations for
excellence. Many of our attorneys have held public office, and many have
served as judges, assistant district attorneys, special counsels to government
agencies, and members of community boards…providing us with a well-rounded
perspective of the legal world from many strategic vantage points, thus
enhancing our ability to serve our clients.

The attorneys of **Carner & DeVita** are continually involved in the
surrounding communities - both where we live and where our practice is
located. Utilizing our knowledge and skills, we energetically strive to make
our communities better places to live, work and conduct business.
