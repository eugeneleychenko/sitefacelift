I must say that you were GREAT to pull a letter together that fast! And guess what - it seemed to have worked."      * "I know we never had an opportunity to meet in person Mr. Muir, but I want you to know how much I appreciate your involvement in this matter. Especially, since this was such a complex matter to begin with."      * "Thanks for the advice - I ended up closing the deal for a premium on top of the old price. You're great!" [Along with this note was a $100 check for a brief conversation even though no invoice was sent.]      * "I wanted to again thank you for handling our case, and for the level of service that you and Olga provided... Your experience with this type of real estate litigation is extensive... I felt comfortable that you thoroughly understood our case and, more importantly, the various options that developed during its progress. I can't say that about my prior lawyers."     _These testimonials or endorsements do not constitute a guaranty, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of your legal matter._ 2024 Law Offices of Robert E Muir.
