## **About Beverly**

Beverly was originally a part of Salem, Massachusetts. It was first settled in
1626 by members of the Dorchester Company. Since then, Beverly has grown into
a vibrant community with a population of 42,062. Beverly is known as the
"Birthplace of the American Revolution" because it is the site of the first
cotton mill. Beverly was also the location of one of the first Sunday schools
in the United States. Beverly has a wide variety of places to see and things
to do, including David S. Lynch Memorial Park, The Larcom Performing Arts
Theatre, Long Hill and the Sedgwick Gardens, Baker's Island, and Independence
Park, which is the park where Captain John Glover read the Declaration of
Independence for locals on July 17, 1776.

**Business Litigation**

Conflicts and disputes can sometimes be unavoidable when running a business.
When your company suffers damages or is accused of harming another person or
entity, you need capable legal representation that will do everything possible
to protect your interests.

  * ![Securities Litigation](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

**Securities Litigation**

Securities conflicts are often delicate, highly sensitive affairs that can
result in significant financial loss or severe reputational damage if
mishandled. Effectively adjudicating these matters involves a deep
understanding of the complex regulatory laws.

  * ![Criminal Defense](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

When you are charged with a crime, you need legal representation that will do
everything possible to protect your interests. Our Beverly criminal defense
lawyers at Gelb & Gelb LLP have over 30 years of experience representing our
clients in state and federal courtrooms.

  * ![Regulatory Proceedings](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

**Regulatory Proceedings**

Gelb & Gelb LLP represents individuals and businesses before state and federal
regulatory agencies and licensing authorities. We appreciate that clients’ top
priority is protecting their livelihoods, especially when they have spent
years establishing their reputations.

  * ![Academic & Student Misconduct Defense](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

**Academic & Student Misconduct Defense**

When a student or faculty member is charged with academic dishonesty or any
type of criminal offense, they are generally subject to internal
administrative disciplinary proceedings to investigate whether the
institution’s code of conduct was violated and whether sanctions are
necessary. These proceedings can jeopardize your professional reputation,
career, and enrollment and should be taken extremely seriously.

  * ![Domestic Relations / Family Law](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

**Domestic Relations / Family Law**

At Gelb & Gelb LLP, we strive to make difficult and complex family matters
manageable for our clients. We represent clients in Massachusetts courts when
they're facing even the most complex family law issues.

  * ![Probate Litigation / Estate Disputes](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

**Probate Litigation / Estate Disputes**

In an ideal world, probate would be a simple process. After a loved one passes
away, you would review the terms of their estate plan, inventory their assets,
and disperse their property in accordance with their final wishes.
