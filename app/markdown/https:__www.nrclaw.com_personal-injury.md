## FAQ:

 **Should I contact a personal injury lawyer?**  
A personal injury lawyer should be used when you have suffered serious injury,
illness, or permanent disability because of someone else’s negligence. They
can also represent the surviving spouse, children, parents, minor dependents,
and any members of household who were supported by a victim of wrongful death.
A personal injury attorney will help to secure fair financial compensation in
order to provide stability during this emotional period of your life — and
beyond.

 **When should I hire a personal injury lawyer?**  
You should ideally hire a personal injury lawyer before speaking to any
insurance companies. Because insurance companies want to limit payouts as much
as possible, they may coerce you into admission of guilt or minimize your
injury to avoid paying you large sums. Legal counsel will protect you to help
ensure you’re payed the full amount that will ease the burden of your loss.  
You also want to begin evaluating your claim right away for the best evidence.
Don’t rely on police reports to provide accurate or sufficient data. Police
reports are often inadmissible in personal injury cases.

 **What makes a good personal injury case?**  
A personal injury case relies on proof of pain and financial losses that have
been incurred. Demonstrate the impact on your quality of life, i.e. if your
resulting injury, illness, or disability will require long-term care.

Physically, account for the type of injuries, their severity, and the expected
length of recovery time. The location of the injuries can add validity to your
claim.

  * Financially, losses may include the amount of medical bills resulting from your accident, or any reduced income because you were unable to work as often or at all. Include medical and employment records.

 **What questions should you ask a personal injury lawyer?**  
When you’ve been injured in an accident through no fault of your own, ensure
that your personal injury lawyer is equipped to establish liability with the
following questions:

  * Do you have litigation and courtroom experience with a similar case?
  * Do you specialize in personal injury law?
  * What is your track record of success?
  * What is your assessment of my case regarding compensation?
  * What are your expectations for the timeline of my case?
  * What are your contingency fees and legal costs?

 **What do personal injury lawyers do?**  
A personal injury lawyer secures compensation to cover medical expenses and
lost income when someone else is legally responsible for your suffering. Your
lawyer will handle the full investigation, gathering data such as logs,
videotapes, and policy manuals to prove the cause and extent of damages. They
will identify and contact all witnesses and guilty parties. A personal injury
lawyer also helps you to avoid jeopardizing your claim, from your social media
posts to your adherence to medical treatment plans.

 **What kind of cases do personal injury lawyers handle?**  
Personal injury lawyers defend victims who have suffered physical harm or a
loved one’s death due to the negligence of a person and/or company. This
includes auto accidents, brain injuries, burn injuries, and more. It may also
extend to negligence at the hands of child daycares, elderly care, and
hospitals.
