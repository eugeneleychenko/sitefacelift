## We'll Speak Your Language   
- Literally And Figuratively

  * The workers' compensation process can be complex and confusing for someone who has never had to deal with a work injury before. Educated clients will make better choices regarding their legal matters, which often lead to better results.
  * Bo Katzakian is an experienced bilingual attorney who can provide a level of personal service and attention that takes the uncertainty out of legal counsel. We work with our clients one-on-one to ensure every question is answered, every injury issue is addressed and every compensation package covers the full scope of our clients' needs.

## Let Our Clients Tell You

Our clients are our number one priority, and it shows in the positive feedback we have gotten from them over the years.

The most knowledgeable workers compensation lawyer I have ever hired and the only one I recommend. Bo always answered my questions and concerns right away. And through his hard work I received the settlement I deserved. Thank you Bo for being there for me!

**—Teresa**

I hired him after the previous lawyer that I had was not doing anything for me with my case. He was straight forward and to the point. Explained that it would be a process and it would take time. It took about a year and half but case settled. Thanks Bo.
