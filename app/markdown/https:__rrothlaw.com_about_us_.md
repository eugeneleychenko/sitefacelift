# About Us

The Roth Law Firm is an aggressive and innovative small New York City law firm
that has built a strong reputation as a premiere litigation boutique firm in
the metropolitan area. Its strength lies in its ability to “take the gloves
off” when necessary and its creative “out of the box” strategizing and
negotiating. Because of these unique skills, the firm has achieved national
and international prominence and recognition in various areas of commercial,
entertainment and business litigation.

The Firm has significant experience in all phases of litigation from the
resolution of a dispute before the commencement of an action, through
discovery and motion practice, to the end of the battle — be it by settlement,
mediation, trial, appeal or post judgment enforcement. It litigates in state
and federal courts and arbitrations across the nation -- from Anchorage to
Miami -- with particular concentration in the New York metropolitan area.

The Firm’s diverse practice also includes other disciplines. It has a real
estate practice, which is comprised of both residential and commercial real
estate divisions. The Firm also has attorneys who engage in both simple and
comprehensive transactions in the trusts & estates, tax, corporate,
entertainment, class actions and matrimonial arenas. For a small practice, the
Firm prides itself as being a “one stop shop” for its clientele.
