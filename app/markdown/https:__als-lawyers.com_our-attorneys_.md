## Our Attorneys

At Arye, Lustig & Sassower, P.C., we have a distinguished record of success
representing people who have been seriously injured in all accidents. Our
lawyers have earned hundreds of six-figure and seven-figure verdicts and
settlements, including over $500,000. Over the years, we have secured more
than $1 billion.  
Our results are meaningful in several ways. First, in each case, our clients
have received the financial resources they need to live the fullest possible
life after a significant, even catastrophic, injury. Second, these results
demonstrate our proven ability to achieve positive outcomes in both litigation
and negotiations.  
Please follow the links below to learn more about our credentials and
experience.
