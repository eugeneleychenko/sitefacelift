Personal relationships with clients throughout the representation is a
priority for us. We stress communication and cooperation.  
CGC is dedicated to providing personalized service and to establishing durable
personal relationships with clients in order to understand their businesses
and objectives comprehensively. In short, we want not only to advise clients.
We want to be part of their team.



Crystal and Giannoni-Crystal, LLC (CGC), is committed to providing high-
quality legal services with passion, speed, and integrity in a few selected
areas: Lawyers for lawyers services , international services , contract and
business services .



This South Carolina, New York, and DC law firm’s value is, above all, in the
experience of its founders. Nathan Crystal has taught and consulted primarily
in the field of professional responsibility and contracts for almost 40 years.
In her almost vicennial career spanning Italy and the US, Francesca Giannoni-
Crystal she has provided assistance to a wide range of clients (industrial,
commercial and technological companies, banks & financial institutions, law
firms) both domestically and internationally in contractual issues,
international agreements, technology and Internet contracts, and corporate
law.



There are several circumstances in which an experienced transactional attorney
can be of great assistance.



While CGC is primarily a transactional law firm, we offer some litigation
services. Nathan Crystal is available to handle appellate cases, can serve as
an expert witness (particularly in contract and professional ethics matters),
and can represent attorneys and judges before the South Carolina Commissions
on Lawyer and Judicial Conduct. We offer dispute resolutions also. Francesca
Giannoni-Crystal provides "bridging" services in transactions as well as in
litigation.



We can provide professional legal services in English, Italian, and Spanish,
and we can offer advice with regard to transactions and legal documents in
German, French, and Portuguese.



In addition to the professionals "in alliance" listed in this website, the
founders have strong links with international practices around the world, to
serve clients’ cross-border needs in business law.
