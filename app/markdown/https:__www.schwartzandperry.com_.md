### WHY DO I NEED AN EMPLOYMENT LAW ATTORNEY?

You are not required to have an attorney represent you in an employment law
dispute, but you are very unlikely to succeed without one. Many people who
have experienced mistreatment and abuse at work don’t know how to assert their
rights in court, and some may not even be aware of all the rights they have.

You need a legal advocate on your side with the experience and skill to fight
for what you deserve. At Schwartz Perry & Heller LLP, our NYC employment law
attorneys have over 50 years of combined experience when it comes to fighting
on behalf of those who have suffered a violation of their rights at work. We
understand employment law and how it applies to our clients in any given legal
dispute, which makes us the attorneys you need to fight for fair and just
compensation.

Our New York City employment attorneys also offer personalized and
compassionate legal support for our clients. This means we’ll treat you with
dignity and respect as we address your unique legal situation with a
customized strategy.

 **Our NYC employment lawyers can handle the following types of disputes and
more:**

  * Age, race, religious, pregnancy, sexual orientation and gender discrimination
  * Sexual harassment
  * Disability discrimination and denial of reasonable accommodation requests
  * Hostile work environment
  * Retaliation
  * Wrongful termination
  * Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) wage claims

 **Don't face employee discrimination alone.** **Contact** **our New York
employment law attorneys to defend you today!**

### What Are My Rights as an Employee in New York?

Various local, state and federal employment laws protect workers in New York.
Broadly, these laws concern an employer’s hiring and termination practices,
working conditions, and compensation and benefits, among other things.
Additionally, they provide that an employee should be free from
discrimination, sexual harassment and retaliation for reporting misconduct.

 **A few examples of state and federal employment laws include, but are not
limited to:**

  * Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
  * Age Discrimination in Employment Act
  * Americans with Disabilities Act
  * Family Medical and Leave Act
  * New York State Anti-Discrimination Law
  * New York City Human Rights Law
  * Fair Labor Standards Act
  * New York Labor Law

### How are Worker Protection Laws Upheld in New York?

Employers must comply with the law and have policies and procedures in place
to ensure protections are upheld. Whether or not employees sign contracts with
their employer, they should not be subject to treatment that violates their
rights. Employers or any person working for an employer can be held
accountable for unlawful or discriminatory treatment against workers. Don't
hesitate to reach out to contact our attorneys through our online form, or by
calling us at (646) 490-0221.

 **Misconduct at work that could be considered a violation of employment laws
includes, but is not limited to:**

  * Making adverse employment decisions because of a person’s status in a protected class
  * Denying reasonable accommodations
  * Requesting sexual favors in exchange for a career benefit
  * Firing, cutting pay, or demoting a worker who reported prohibited conduct

If you or a colleague have been treated unjustly at work, please do not
hesitate to reach out to our New York employment law lawyers at Schwartz Perry
& Heller LLP. We understand that this can be an emotional and challenging time
for you, and discussing these matters can be hard. By speaking up, you can
address and seek remedy for the issue, preventing any such behavior from
continuing in the future.

Our NYC employment law attorneys will deliver the compassionate support you
need throughout your case. We will stand by your side, ensuring that you
understand your rights and legal options.

####  Our Past Clients Speak to Our Experience

  * > **"Always available, conscientious and extremely knowledgeable."**
>
> Outstanding lawyer. Always available, conscientious and extremely

> **\- N.W.**

  * > **"Their integrity, personal attention, and knowledge are superior."**
>
> Schwartz, Perry & Heller, LLP are the most skilled Lawyers for your

> **\- D.K.**

  * > **"Hands down the best employment lawyers you will find."**
>
> Brain Heller was my lawyer, but I got two for the price of one as Davida
> Perry was there every step of the way. They were always available to answer
> any questions, comments or concerns I had regarding my case. They were both
> extremely kind, compassionate and caring. I was updated every step of the
> way. They are both honest, transparent and hardworking; the most difficult
> task was parting ways with them as the make your apart of their family.
> Hands down the best employment lawyers you will find.

  * > **"Schwarz, Perry and Heller (“SPH”) fought hard to make sure I could part from my firm with my head held high."**
>
> Having gone through a very traumatic journey in battle with my employer,
> Schwarz, Perry and Heller (“SPH”) fought hard to make sure I could part from
> my firm with my head held high. I wanted to share my experience so that
> others who may have the misfortune to be in similar situations and in need
> of good counsel to help them through it and fight on their behalf can turn
> to SPH with the confidence that they will have not only excellent lawyers
> but also compassionate partners. Most law firms and lawyers will fight hard
> to win your case, in contingency scenarios their income and profits are
> dependent upon a win. And that, of course, is fair enough. The difference at
> SPH is their approach and the way they handle each individual case and
> client, as exactly what we are, individuals. Though they deal with cases
> that have many similarities, theirs is not a cookie cutter one size fits all
> approach. The lawyers that partner with you take the time and care to really
> listen to you to understand what your have gone through and how you
> personally need to be supported through the journey ahead. They genuinely
> care about helping those hard done by, even when it means taking on big
> firms. From my experience, I can attest that SPH will confidently go toe to
> toe with big corporate law firms (that seek to protect and defend employers)
> as they fight for your rights and your dignity. I consider myself to be a
> very strong person but I honestly could not have gotten through the battle
> against my employer if it hadn’t been for the SPH team’s care and support of
> me, and their passion and legal strategies to remedy the wrongs that had
> been done to me. Davida Perry, one of the firms most senior partners, was
> personally engaged in my case day, night, even weekends if required. In
> getting to know Davida over a period of several months, I can say that she
> genuinely cares about helping people and is deeply passionate about righting
> wrongs. I hope never to be in a situation where I might need a lawyer to
> help me in this manner again, but if I did, it would be SPH!
