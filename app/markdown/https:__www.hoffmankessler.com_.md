## **About** Kessler & Green

Kessler & Green is an agile, responsive law firm that works tirelessly to
achieve our clients’ goals, while adding significant value to their
businesses.

Each of us has years of experience in successful practice at major law firms.
We are small by intention; we practice together because we want to. By working
together closely and never in competition with one another, we deliver the
carefully considered, experience-driven advice and first rate work product
that our clients need and deserve.

We go to uncommon lengths to listen attentively to our clients’ objectives. We
create a hands-on, user-friendly collaboration with each of our clients,
project after project— an experience that forges enduring trust and confidence
between our clients and each of us.

Our size and effective overhead management enable us to offer our clients
favorable rates and creative fee arrangements in appropriate circumstances.
After five years in practice together (as Hoffman & Kessler), we are proud of
the successful results we have achieved for our clients. We look forward to
achieving many more.

We concentrate our practice on a wide range of commercial and intellectual
property litigation, as well as an equally wide range of corporate and
securities matters, including, complex contract work, mergers and
acquisitions, debt and equity financings, governance matters and general
business needs. Our clients include entrepreneurs, start up businesses and mid
size and large private and public companies. We represent clients in New York,
Michigan and throughout the United States.

We are committed to providing each of our clients with unmatched personal
attention and the work quality and expertise associated with the finest law
firms. We welcome the opportunity to serve every day.
