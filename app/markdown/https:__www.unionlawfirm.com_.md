Let me put it to you this way: I was seriously injured in a fall from a
partially renovated fire-escape that had been left unfinished for 5 + years.
The first firm I hired, through one of its partners (the associate handling my
case left for another firm) insisted that my injuries wouldn't amount to even
$100,000. I disagreed.I went shopping for another firm. Michael Rose took my
case, and a little less than 2 years later, I received 4 times that amount.Do
I really need to say more?

My name is Robert Zimmer, I recently was introduced to Mr Greg Hack of this
firm. I was very pleased in our discussion about my current situation as a man
that had worked in an industry for over 40 years . Mr Hack's level of
communication between client and lawyer is a compliment in an area where men
like myself do not know , who to talk too or what too ask for. I would
recommend Mr Greg Hack to anyone seeking assistance. His professional
assessment and knowledge was outstanding.

Great! Although Hach & Rose, LLP has many Team Members, my experience with
both Anthony H who I call Esquire, & Filomena who Fullfills The Means, is
greatly appreciated. Importantly is that they know the Rules & have many
resources such as Doctor's, Physical Theropists, and Personal Help. With
consistant Follow-ups, I had to tell them that; "No News Is Good News!"
However, they kept their Follow-ups from beginning thru the end. I'm now
Sitting On Top Of A Gold Mine! Thanks to the Hach & Rose, LLP.

I was in a bad scaffold accident back in 2012, it's not a time in my life that
I like to look back at, but I am thankful that I am still alive. I was in
tremendous pain when I called the law firm of Hach & Rose, so Michael Rose
himself came to the hospital to see me. That alone meant so much to me, he
assured me that they will handle the case on behalf while I focus on my
recovery. In the end, I was happy with the compensation and I am thankful that
I have the financial security to support my family. Although I have not fully
recovered, my life is back on track and I get to play with my kids again.

Originally I Had a different attorney for my case. Was hit from behind by a
car while I was commuting on my bike. This attorney was recommend by an
employee at my doctor’s office. He only called me once. I called several
times. In the end I realized that he didn’t care. It was hard to believe that
he didn’t care. Once I got that through my head, I began searching the
nternet. I came across to Hach and Rose LLP. I spoke to Mr.Michael Ross. It
was later on in the afternoon and I was surprised when he asked to see me
then. It was a welcome surprise, of course, an instant indication to me about
their willingness to help. I wasted no time and went to the office. He got all
the information I had and started my case immediately. I knew from the start
that I was in good hands. I felt confident. I kept getting calls, and updates
in the mail. I was never left hanging or waiting or wondering.Hach and Rose
cared. I want to thank you for being so profetional and helpful. Michael,
please know I trusted in you from the start, from our first meeting. I knew it
would be a matter of time. Thank you very much again, and my regards to your
staff.Best regards, Peter Cass5

Hach and Rose was highly recommended to me by a friend for my personal injury

skeptical of everything. They were there for me throughout every step of my

big, too small, or annoying to them and going through a process like this you
will have many questions that need to be answered. Mike Rose and his team
ALWAYS treated me with the utmost respect and compassion. They are the same
people before and after everything is over. I am blessed to have the best in

I was dealing with the insurance company regarding the accident until they
offered me a pittance for my damaged clothing. A friend recommended Michael
Rose and it was a fabulous recommendation. Mr. Rose is caring, responsive, and
a fantastic lawyer. He was able to get me more than 9 times (just like those
commercials) of what the insurance company offered. He keeps you aware of what
is happening and responds quickly to your calls. I highly recommend him. If

This is a comprehensive review about my case. I was involved in a motorcycle
accident in 2017. At a first glance, people would blame a motorcycle for
causing an accident regarding the way they ride, but in my case I was the one
riding. I had a fracture on my ankle which required me to be in the hospital
for couple of days. Once the cops showed up after the accident, they thought
it was my fault without even knowing the facts. Once I started to look to hire
an attorney to fight my case, based on the previous reviews, I chose Hach &
Rose to represent me in this matter. Michael Rose and Mark Sokoloff heard my
situation and promised a positive outcome. My case was taken by John Blyth. He
is a professional along with all the other attorney's and staff. Please be
aware that complicated cases take a lot of time to get settled unless it is an
open and shut case. If you are planning to use this firm, I would absolutely
suggest you to. I would definitely recommend this firm to my friends and
family if they require and you should too.

My experience with Hach & Rose exceeded all of my expectations. After
extensively researching potential personal injury lawyers, I chose this firm
to represent my case. The reviews I read convinced me that the firm had the
knowledge and background in slip and fall accidents, which was how I was
injured.I reached out and was able to schedule a consultation
forthwith.Immediately after being introduced to my lawyer, Natasha Berg, I
knew that I had made the right choice. It was the first time that I had ever
filed a lawsuit so I did have my doubts. She assured me that I had a viable
case and that her law firm had the expertise to deliver a positive solution.
She walked me through the entire process and made sure that I knew I could
reach out to her at any time with any questions. Natasha was reliable,
efficient, and most importantly, made me feel extremely comfortable. She was
an amazing person to work with.We won my case and it settled for more than I
had originally anticipated!I recommend Hach & Rose for anyone who needs a law
firm to represent them on a personal injury accident. I was so reluctant to
file a law suit but it turned out to be an opportunity for a fresh start.

I was recommended to Hach & Rose, LLPin NY by another attorney from NJ. I
called the office and received an operative immediately. The office was
flexible and accommodated to meeting with me outside of their designated

about my case. He explained my situations and options in terminology I could
understand. The office communicated often and in detail about the status of
the case, without me asking! They showed true dedication and attention to my
case and needs. Aaron was assigned to my case and we connected at first

I actually came across Hach & Rose one night after desperately looking for a
new Personal Injury Lawyer. The lawyer I had at the time was unresponsive and
somewhat apathetic. Anyway, I filled out an inquiry on their website and
Michael Rose called me immediately!! This had to be around 9:30pm, talk about
dedication to the job! From that point on, I knew I was in good hands. Michael
gave me his personal number and he was always just a phone call or text
message away. He, along with everyone else at the firm, worked effortlessly to
get me the compensation I deserved. Michael is professional, diligent, and
committed. Oh he's also verrryyy funny! Overall, he and his team put me at

After reviewing several law firms for my Personal Injury case, I met with Hach
& Rose and Michael Rose, Attorney and his team. I was immediately at ease and
trusted their opinion of my case and knew they would have my best interests at
heart. As my case progressed, Hach & Rose kept me up to date on all actions
they were taking, the status of the case of the aggressive stance and filings
they were pursuing on my behalf. Even as Covid hit and a massive slow down
occurred within the court system in NY, Hach & Rose stayed aggressive and
looked for ways to bring my case to a settlement/conclusion. Which in July
2021, they were able to settle my case successfully and to my 100%
satisfaction. I cannot recommend Hach & Rose and in particular Mike Rose any
higher. In short they are firm, fair, aggressive, responsive, super smart and

The lawyers at Hach & Rose held my hand through a very difficult process and
kept me from losing hope. More importantly they got me top dollar for my
settlement. Always available to speak to anytime I had a question or problem,
great responsive staff, took the time to explain things and never made me feel
like I was taking too much of their time or asking dumb questions. Honestly,
lawyer Mike Rose and his staff became my second family during my lawsuit and
beyond. Thanks again.

I cannot say enough good things about Hach & Rose, but specifically John
Blyth. John handled my case with the utmost professionalism and provided great
guidance throughout the process. From our initial meeting until resolution,
John was a great advocate for my case and I truly appreciate his client
focused approach to conducting his business. I am grateful for the services he
provided and would chose him again in a heartbeat.

Short story:Hach and Rose is an AMAZING law firm. It would be a mistake to go
anywhere else in my opinion! They're experts in this space. I got a nice 6
figure settlement. From the date of the accident until I got paid was about 4½
years and it might have been maybe a year and a half shorter. It was extended
due to the health crisis.Long story:I'm a Union Electrician in NYC and
unfortunately I had an accident at work. My accident kept me out of work for
nearly 2 years. Somehow, I came across the law firm of Hach and Rose. I'm
pretty sure it was through a Google search.When I contacted them, they were
quick to get back to me and we set up a consultation. They looked over my case
and they decided to take it.Hach and Rose and their team were ABSOLUTELY
AMAZING from beginning to end! They kept me up to speed on everything I needed
to be kept up to speed on. They were always responsive to my questions about
the case and in general the staff is compromised of some really great
people.Going into this I had no idea what the process would be but they
managed to make the whole thing run smoothly. The preparation for my case was
brilliant.In the end, my case was settled for a LIFE CHANGING amount and I'm
MORE than satisfied. I feel whole again.My attorney was Aaron H. Also involved
in my case were Genesis, and Filomena. AMAZING guys. I thank you and my family
thanks you.I highly recommend Hach and Rose and I wouldn't hesitate to use
them again if the situation arises.

anxieties through the process. I am very happy with the result they were able

I am so grateful to have Hach & Rose representing me. When you’ve been in an
accident, especially one in which you’ve been seriously injured, it is
physically, financially, and emotionally stressful on so many levels. It
impacts every aspect of your life.When I first started working with Mike Rose
and his team, I was really overwhelmed by the complexity of my case. Mike was
very patient with me, and he listened carefully to my concerns. He expressed
empathy for what I was going through, and he fully explained what I could
expect as my case works its way through the New York State Court system.I
can’t even begin to tell you what a relief it is to know that Mike and his
team are doing everything possible for me from a legal perspective. It’s as
though a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. His work is thorough,
he communicates very efficiently, and I have complete confidence in his
integrity. I trust him 100%.

\- Chris H. ”

a number. They treat you like a real person with needs.Again, I Highly

Yeah I thought they knew what they was doing but for some reason Nina won’t
call me back it’s been months I have told them It was a problem and they
needed to call the surgeon office to handle this she said she did and now I
have a 12k doctor bill we have a problem and someone needs to fix it ASAP ok
so I’m happy to say that my lawyer office has started to fix the problem and
so far it’s going well just waiting to make sure I won’t be held liable for
that medical bill

\- Krystal Henry ”

Highly recommended! The accident and subsequent hospital stay were a traumatic
experience but having H&R; represent me, put me at ease and let me focus on
recovery. John Blyth and his team handled my case swiftly and with utmost
professionalism.

Michael Rose represented me in a personal injury automobile accident I was
involved in. I was not at fault, suffered multiple injuries, and my friend's
car was destroyed. The other party's insurance company initially would not
provide any coverage and I had to endure 2 surgeries and physical therapy for
4 years. Michael Rose was there consistently from start to completion and
secured me a fair & honest settlement for over $1 million dollars. He worked
with me in a consistent and efficient manner during the entire process. I
could not have asked for better and I highly recommend him and his team.

\- Gerald ”

“

My case was a small part of a much larger legal situation, but my borrowed car
was completely totaled in an accident. I still got "big client" treatment from
Michael and his team. I highly recommend him. He's professional,
knowledgeable, and has a great support team around him. My case went on for
over 3 years, but he was unwavering in his commitment to get me a well-
deserved settlement.

\- Roy ”

“

5 Stars across the board. They were willing to help me in anyway they could.
They provided me with answers where no one else could. I never felt rushed
being as they took the time to answer all of my questions and provided me with
the valuable advice that I desperately needed. If you’re tired of getting the
run around and being treated like a statistic, then these are definitely the
guys to go to. A+++!!!

\- J.M. ”

“

I was injured in a car accident and was dealing with the insurance company
until they offered me a pittance for my damaged clothing. A friend recommended
Michael Rose. I can't thank her enough for the recommendation. Mr. Rose is a
caring, responsive and extremely competent lawyer. He is responsive to calls
and keeps you updated on the activities of the case. He got a settlement
almost 10 times more than what the insurance company offered. I highly
recommend him. He makes you feel as if you are his number one client. If you
need a personal injury lawyer, Michael Rose is THE lawyer to use.

I found Hach and Rose Law Firm to be special not only as a Law Firm but as a
business in General. My reasoning – there ability to stay consistent with the
problems and persistent with the mundane subjects, phone calls, and computer
information sent to them that they had to refer to. Not once did this cease at
all in the most mundane subject they gave their attention. The operators who
took my defensive calls never became offensive as I would have. Michael was
not to be believed, really he was outstanding, and personal, at the same time
professional. I’m not saying these things to flatter or influence their the
truth.

## Common Personal Injury Claims in New York, NY

### Car Accident Claims

The most common type of personal injury claim that most personal injury law
firms handle are automobile accidents and various forms of motor vehicle
accidents. Even in New York, where only 45% of households own a car, auto
accidents are incredibly common. An automobile accident can have many
complexities and often require an experienced personal injury lawyer to
navigate. If you are involved in a car accident, the insurance companies may
try to "low-ball" or offer you a settlement worth less than the true amount.
Our experienced personal injury lawyers are able to pursue damages for car
accidents relating to medical bills, the cost of replacing your vehicle, lost
wages, emotional distress, and more.

### Construction Accident Claims

New York is an ever-growing, ever-changing city. It is estimated that in 2022,
over $55.5 billion was spent on construction. Our law firm has a proven track
record of representing accident victims in New York City for various work-
related accidents. We help accident victims to pursue any income lost and
receive fair financial compensation.

our New York City injury attorneys for a free consultation.

of personal injury lawsuits for the surviving family members. Having a team of

the family to grieve while the attorney navigates litigation. Damages in a
wrongful death claim include medical expenses, the deceased's person's

income, and funeral and burial expenses.
