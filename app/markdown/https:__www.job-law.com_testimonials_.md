If it was not for Mr. Sessions, I would not have received my compensation.
Everyone was very professional and courteous.

Carol M.

The most valuable service was the initial relief of turning over the entire
mess to a competent attorney. It allowed me to move on. You continued far past
the place I would have stopped. Tenacity.

Lynda G.

Don Sessions is an extraordinary employment lawyer. He was professional.
Handled my own case with a sense of urgency. Kept in contact and handled my
criticism well. Timely, efficient. Everyone helped.

Deb F.

Your firm was able to put a closure to my claim which I started with another
firm. Steve Kimball was very communicative with me, upfront and straight
forward. He was able to get the job done that my previous attorney could not.
Quick response time to my first phone call for a phone conference, able to use
fax and mail for signing documents – closed my claim in a short time! I wish I
had come to your firm at the onset of my claim and I am sure the outcome would
have been much greater and satisfying if I had obtained your services earlier
on. Thank you for the closure.

Shirley B.

Steve Kimball fully explained to me the process to where I understood what to
expect and there were no surprises. Very professionally executed. Steve, it
was fortunate for me when I located you and your law firm. Your services
provided the remedy I was in search of. It was an extreme pleasure to have you
represent me.
