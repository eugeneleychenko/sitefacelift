SEC Investigations and Enforcement Actions

We handle matters involving complicated securities law, accounting and FCPA
fact patterns. Over and over again, we have achieved favorable results for our
clients.

White Collar Criminal Defense

We are well known for helping clients navigate difficult terrain, where the
hazards can be many. Most white collar criminal defense matters do not involve
indictment and trial, at least if the right strategic decisions are made early
on. Where there has to be a trial, though, we know how to win.

International Matters

We have established relationships with skilled practitioners in the UK and
elsewhere, and with them often deal with investigations that are international
in scope.

Complex Commercial Litigation

We handle complex commercial litigation matters. Our trial experience informs
everything that we do and enables us to work efficiently and effectively to
achieve favorable outcomes for our clients consistent with their goals.

Internal Investigations

We conduct internal investigations, in support of the work of board committees
and for companies. Recent investigations have included allegations of
accounting irregularities and other sensitive matters.
