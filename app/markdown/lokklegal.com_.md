Henry R.  
​Whenever I a client that needs a contract reviewed or a LLC formed I never hesitate to send them to Lokk Legal because I know they will get the personalized, detailed attention that they expect. Koorosh is very knowledgeable about contracts and business formation and is adept at tackling the unique issues that arise with every transaction. I will continue to refer my clients to Lokk legal for all of their business needs!

Lilly G.  
I highly recommend LOKK Legal. Small businesses in San Diego who need to get their paperwork in place really don't need to look any further… that is, if they want to work with someone who understands the legal issues, breaks them down in a conversational way, and focuses on the result of getting you the paperwork you need to operate successfully.
