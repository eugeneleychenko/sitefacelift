In an ideal world, no one would be treated differently because of who they
are. Unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world. Instances of
discrimination are extremely common – especially in workplaces – and as a
result many individuals do not get the opportunities they deserve and are
denied the rights to which they are entitled.

If you are facing issues of discrimination at work, it is important to consult
with a committed and reliable New York discrimination attorney and find out
how you can protect your rights. The employment attorneys at Levine & Blit
have over 100 years of combined experience and are committed to fighting for
the rights of those who face discrimination and harassment at work. We can
hold your employer accountable for their discriminatory behavior and make sure
you get the opportunities and benefits you deserve.

**What Constitutes Discrimination in New York?**

New York’s Human Rights Law makes it illegal for employers to discriminate
against applicants or employees based on their race, gender, disability,
sexual orientation, or any other protected class. You can find the full list
of protected classes here.

Under the law, employers – regardless of their size or revenue – are
prohibited from treating employees differently due to their association with a
protected characteristic or class. If an employer takes any kind of adverse
employment-related action against applicants, employees, or independent
contractors belonging to a protected class, it can be considered an act of
discrimination.

Common examples of employment discrimination include:

  * Denying you employment.
  * Denying you promotion, benefits, and privileges that are available for other employees.
  * Excluding you from training sessions, meetings, workshops, conferences, and other programs that can advance your career.
  * Demoting, taking disciplinary action, or terminating you for raising issues of discrimination at work.
  * Making offensive remarks about the protected class you belong to.

Remember – New York’s Human Rights Law is far more comprehensive than federal
employment laws and prohibits a wider range of discriminatory behavior. If you
are not sure whether your employer’s actions can be termed discriminatory,
contact an experienced New York discrimination attorney at Levine & Blit.
We’ll help you find out whether your rights have been violated and whether you
have a legitimate case against your employer.

**How Our New York Discrimination Attorneys Can Help You**

We can build a strong case of employment discrimination against your employer
and gather the evidence needed to support your claims. We can determine the
extent of violations committed by your employer and calculate the damages you
are owed. We can negotiate with your employer’s attorney to get a fair
settlement. If an out-of-court settlement is not possible, we can file a
lawsuit and try to recover the maximum possible compensation you are entitled
to under the law.

**Facing Discrimination at Work? Legal Help is Here for You**

At Levine & Blit, we provide personalized legal representation to employees
who are facing discrimination at work. We can take steps to protect your
rights, hold your employer accountable for their discriminatory actions, and
recover the wages, benefits, and compensatory damages you are owed through
negotiation or litigation.

To discuss the possibility of filing a discrimination claim against your
employer, call us today at (212) 967-3000 or fill out the form on this page
and schedule a free case evaluation with a dedicated New York discrimination
attorney from our firm.
