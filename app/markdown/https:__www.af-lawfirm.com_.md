  * > **"Aside from my wife, Jack may very well be the only person in my life that I truly trust"**
>
> Jack Arseneault might very well be one of the best attorneys in the USA,
> however, he is by far a much better person than he is an attorney. He has
> been my attorney for over 25 years and not only has his counseling been
> amazing, but his care for the well-being of myself and my family has gone
> and continues to go above what anyone would expect from their attorney. Jack
> ALWAYS put my needs and my family's needs before his own and advised based
> on what was best for us as opposed to what would make him the most money.
> Aside from my wife, Jack may very well be the only person in my life that I
> truly trust and I am honored and privileged to not only call him my
> attorney, but more importantly one of my best friends.

> **\- Sam**

  * > **"Big heart and empathetic spirit"**
>
> Jack Arseneault was a beacon of hope to my family and I at a time when my
> options appeared limited back in 2011. I pretty much would of been behind
> bars without a doubt if it wasn't for him. Not only was he able to defend
> and clear me of all charges, he made sure my record was cleared. His big
> heart and empathetic spirit offered us emotional support as well. He went
> over and beyond for us, he did things he didn't have to do. He would always
> make time for me and till this day, he's just a phone call away. I thank God
> for bringing him into our lives and I am ETERNALLY grateful for his service.
> I would recommend him without any hesitation.

> **\- Dominique**

  * > **"I had discussed my brother cases with their professional team and they solved my problem."**
>
> My brother was facing criminal charges which were a result of identity
> theft. My friend suggests me to contact Arseneault & Fassett, LLC. I had
> discussed my brother cases with their professional team and they solved my
> problem. My brother was released later that evening. Thanks!

> **\- Mark J.**

  * > **"Their staff is experienced and give you the best solution for your problem."**

> My experience with Arseneault & Fassett, LLC was exceptional: they were

> **\- Charlize J.**

  * > **"Jack is not only a great lawyer, but a great man"**
>
> I hired Jack to defend me in a criminal case brought against me by the
> Federal Government. Jack worked tirelessly for me for over four years which
> resulted in a positive outcome that I believe would not have been achieved
> by any other lawyer.  
> Jack is not only a great lawyer, but a great man. At no point during the
> extremely stressful process did I feel that Jack did not genuinely care
> about me. I don't think that I can adequately write a review that expresses
> the amount of gratitude that I feel for the work that Jack Arseneault did on
> my behalf.

> **\- Frank**

  * > **"Mr. Roberts was able to get me on probation"**
>
> I was facing severe criminal charges and motor vehicle offenses. Mr. Roberts
> was able to get me on probation, also lower my chargers to a lesser offense.
> In the motor vehicle situation I was able to get fines with no points on my
> license.

> **\- Raymond**

  * > **"I was amazed at how quick my record was cleared"**
>
> John Roberts worked quick and efficiently in getting my record expunged. I
> was amazed at how quick my record was cleared. Everything that was asked of
> him he was able to execute. I am grateful for his service. I would recommend
> him without any reservation
>
> **\- Dominique**

  * > **"No words to express his level of commitment and professionalism"**
>
> My name is Vanyo Petrov Minkov and you can google me in order to check that
