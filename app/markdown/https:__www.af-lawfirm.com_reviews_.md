>
> Jack represented me in a criminal case brought by the State of New Jersey,
> Division of Justice, Corruption bureau. The OAG spent five years preparing
> their case, so when they declared my employer and I targets, I was truly
> naive about what would happen next. My family and I are forever thankful
> that we were blessed to find Jack.
>
> During our initial meeting, I told Jack that I was not guilty, and that I
> would never plea to some act I did not commit. Once we agreed on that, true
> to his character, Jack never asked me to consider one. We simply fought the
> state and won.
>
> Jack is a truly a master of his profession. The State provided access to
> over 50,000 cases of files, one case at a time. To be able to narrow the
> amount of evidence to what truly mattered in the case, and be able to defend
> my case so successfully is what makes Jack the best at his profession.
>
> Once my employer settled out financially, and was removed from the case,
> Jack took great care of my family and I. We would have been overwhelmed had
> he not taken us under his wing, and provided the leadership required, and
> emotional support when needed.
>
> I am happy to say that Jack and his team achieved not only the correct
> result, but the results we needed - six not guilty verdicts! We are forever
> thankful for his tireless work on my behalf, and I wholeheartedly recommend
> Jack as your attorney!

> Jack Arseneault is truly one of the good guys out there. A family man,
> straightforward, respectable, and trustworthy.
>
> He helped me immensely and is continuing to help me through a very tough and
> confusing time in my life. The legal system does not always give one the
> most ideal experience and it can take a great deal of time and focus to
> navigate through. I have felt the weight of this and Jack has helped lift
> that weight, made it the most pleasant experience it could possibly be, and
> guided me onto the right path. I have never once doubted that Jack, John,
> and their team had my back and will continue to do so. Jack is one of the
> most selfless people I have ever met and he took me under his wing even when
> he had barely known me when he first took on my case. For all they have done
> I will be forever grateful to him, John, and his team.
>
> P.S. his wife makes the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.
