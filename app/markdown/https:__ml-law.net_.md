### __Trial Lawyers - Historic Settlements

Slade McLaughlin & Paul Lauricella employ an unprecedented approach: two
highly-qualified and experienced personal injury trial lawyers, working side-
by-side, conducting depositions jointly, and even trying your case jointly.

This comprehensive attention to detail recently enabled Slade and Paul to
secure the third largest personal injury verdict in Pennsylvania history, and
some of the largest personal injury settlements in Pennsylvania history,
including a $16,250,000.00 settlement on behalf of a landfill worker who was
run over by a bulldozer. That settlement was secured after more than two weeks
of trial.
