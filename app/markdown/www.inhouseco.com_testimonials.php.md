Testimonials received about our attorneys:   


I have enjoyed working with Alex. In addition to being knowledgeable, he is responsive and cooperative. As a founder of a start up company with limited resources, it is important to work w an attorney who is understanding and willing to work with clients to meet their objectives. I recommend Alex to other inventors.   
**Nikki I**

Alex Chen helps us to deal with the issue of agent related for few years. His professional advice always helps us to make the best decision. Since we are not staying in the States, Alex needs to spend more his private time for discussing the issue. No matter how late we talk to each other, he always do his best to help us to solve the problem.   
**Patty**

Alex Chen is an intelligent and capable leader. His ability to solve customer problems and project the best of intent is among the highest I've seen in my professional experience. I always enjoy interacting with him and appreciate his high integrity and strong commitment to team and success. I cannot say enough about his talent and energy.   
Alex is also very driven, talented,motivated individual. It was a pleasure working with Alex.. There was never anything that Alex considered beyond his capability, too hard, or below him. There is nothing that Alex cannot accomplish. His qwest for knowledge is insatiable and drives his positive behavior. I would highly recommend Alex to anyone that is in need of his professional services without any hesitation.   
**Michael D**

Over the last few years, we did submit provisional and converted some of them into patents applications.   
During that process, Alexander was very helpful and when submitted, he was efficient in following up and getting some of them approved with limited support from us. He helped also with making one of our patent global.   
**Boivin**

First time for me to work on my patent. He professionally reviewed and analyzed what direction to take. His advise was well focused and straight forward within all possibilities. His knowledge and experiences did convinced me. Though it was my first time, whole picture was drawn clearly step by step along with fair payment schedules. I personally do not like waiting period, but the plan was proceeded and resulted as he described. It was a very comfortable waiting ( or investing ) period of time. He also shows other options, pros & cons, and after the successful result. I strongly endorse him. No wondering anymore.   
**Taka**

Alex has assisted me on numerous matters. Especially he represented me in an unlimited civil case. And in the end we won the case 100%. I have enjoyed working with him. He is sharp and has excellent problem solving skills. Besides his fees are not prohibitively high , compared to 5 other attorneys around the Irvine Spectrum that I worked with, none of the other attorneys were as sharp as him! I endorse him as one of the top attorneys that is rare to find.   
**Diana**

Alex has been helping me in obtaining trademarks for my company and he was very informative and always quick to respond. He explained the process to me well and I was always informed each step of the way. In the end we got our trademarks allowed as planned. I highly recommend this attorney.   
**Lee W**

"Ali and Alex, we are glad the case is closed, especially with the result we expected. It was a long journal with ups and downs. We wish we never needed to go through it, but do enjoy work with you and the other members of your team. We learned a lot from you in this completely new experience of our life.Your professional work is very impressive to me in past whole year with Ali and two years and half with Alex. We gave your contact to a couple of friends(real estate agents) who knew the story and feel they might need help from you in the future."   
**Michelle Ma**

Alex has successfully discussed my patent into being accepted into allowance. He was relentless in the pursuit of adapting my utility design after being rejected. This went to the bitter end of time allowance for discussion and decision, and at the very end, he won my patent allowance and I applaud his efforts, his loyalty and his effectual tactics. Well done Alex! Congratulations to you, as well! I am grateful to have your name associated with my patent.   
**Cherie C**

"Being a co-founder of a medical device start-up company, it was prudent for me and the team to identify a reputable law firm to work with us on filing our patent application in order to protect our intellectual property. We are being represented by Alex Chen from Inhouse Law and the advice we received thus far has been nothing but the very best. Alex has expansive knowledge in patent application, IP litigation, as well as prior experience of working in a medical device company. With Alex's guidance, we were able to focus on developing our first generation product, and at the same time being able to secure a strong portfolio of international patents to serve our entrance into the global market. Alex will continue to act as our legal counsel as the company moves through development and into the commercial phase in the coming months."   
**Steve L**

The lawsuit began in 2008. We had hired a lawyer from another firm, and after almost 2 years, no progress was achieved. She eventually tried to convince us to settle the suit. In February 2010, 6 months before the trial, we turned the case to Ali Kamarei. Right away, he determined what action we needed to carry out. The trial was long and intense, lasting 1 month. His extensive knowledge of the law helped us win the case. Ali Kamarei was not just an aggressive lawyer, but he was also sensitive to the personal hardships we had to go through during the trial. He gave us a discount on our legal fees, which was a huge financial relief. I highly recommend Ali Kamarei for all your legal needs.   
**J &J; Seafood Corp.**

We are very thankful for attorney Alexander Chen's help and are very appreciated for his excellent job. We will probably need your help later for other tasks. Again, thank you very much and will refer you to my family and friends who needs for any law assistance.
