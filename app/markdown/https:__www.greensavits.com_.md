## What is Employment Law?

  

Employment Law is a complex area of law, requiring the expertise of an
attorney who is highly trained in the field. It consists of thousands of
federal and state statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions. Additionally,
it regulates the relationship between employers and employees, including what
employers can ask employees, what employers can ask employees to do, and
employees' rights in the workplace. In the perspective of employees rights,
Employee Law serves to protect existing labor legislation and ensure employee
rights receive the benefits they deserve. Major areas of Employment Law
include employment discrimination, employment compensation, wage and hour law,
workplace harassment, retaliation, whistleblower, ERISA and many more.

"Jon Green is a superb attorney with high integrity and empathy. Jon kindly
responded to me and took my case when I was at a most difficult time. The
initial meeting really impressed me when Jon and Glen discussed with me as a
team and grasped the key of my case already with their superb professional
expertise, and I walked out of the door knowing that my case was in good hands
and feeling so much relieved..... I highly recommend Jon Green and Green
Savits Firm for any employment related matter."  

Nancy Z.

  

"Using superb litigation skills during our meditation and its aftermath,
Attorneys Glen Savits and Laura LoGiudice effectively resolved my five year
case vs my former Fortune 100 employer.Glen and Laura helped me heal from
serious financial, physical and emotional injury inflicted by my manager's
illegal and reprehensible discriminatory actions.

For over a decade, my professional performance consistently exceeded both
assigned annual goals and metrics delivered by peers. And for almost as long,
I tolerated a hostile and unlawful work environment.  
At long last, life can move on."
