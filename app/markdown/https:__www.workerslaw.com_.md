# New York Workplace Accident Attorneys and Personal Injury Lawyers

* * *

**More Than 90 Years of Fighting Hard and Winning Big For Injured New Yorkers
Like You**

You've come to us for a reason—and you've come to the right place. With more
than eight decades of experience in defending the rights of New Yorkers, our
workers’ compensation lawyers help clients get the justice they deserve.
Whether you need help with a workers' compensation claim because you got hurt
on a construction site or you aren't sure of your rights as an injured union
member, Pasternack Tilker Ziegler Walsh Stanton & Romano, LLP is here to help.

These are just a few of our areas of practice. We are experienced New York
workers' compensation lawyers and New York personal injury attorneys who help
people just like you who are facing a variety of difficult circumstances. If
you are struggling with a Social Security Disability claim or need help
pursuing a civil service disability pension, contact our experienced legal
professionals today for a free consultation.

Don't underestimate the seriousness of your accident or injury. What might
seem like a straightforward case can quickly become a complicated legal
problem. With so much at stake, it's critical you contact an experienced New
York workers' compensation lawyer to discuss the details of your case. Your
future could be at stake.

## Don't take any unnecessary risks.

### Contact us today. Call 800-692-3717.

We are a full-service law firm that seamlessly integrates and pursues your
claims smoothly, from start to settlement. For example, an on-the-job injury
can produce separate negligence, workers compensation and disability claims.
This might be the case if a construction worker is seriously injured on a job
site and the negligence can be traced back to a third party (someone other
than the employer). Our experienced worker’s compensation attorneys can
evaluate your specific circumstances and help with your legal options.

Learn more about our legal experience and knowledge. Read our legal articles.

Don’t expect your employer or an insurance company to look out for your best
interests. Insurance companies are often focused on one thing: paying injury
victims as little as possible. That’s not right, and that’s one reason why our
personal injury lawyers fight so hard for people just like you every day in
New York City.

Our New York workers’ compensation attorneys have literally hundreds of years
of combined experience litigating multiple claims for our clients. In many
cases, litigation has not been needed due to our extensive track record and
reputation. While our trial experience is a powerful weapon, opponents don’t
want to face us in court. With a powerful New York personal injury lawyer on
your side, you’ll very likely be offered a good settlement without having to
go to trial. But they know we’re ready, willing and able to take your case to
trial if necessary.

Because our personal injury lawyers practice in all State and Federal Courts
in New York, as well as before all federal, state and local administrative
agencies, you can rest assured that you are in extremely capable legal hands.
