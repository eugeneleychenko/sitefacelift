Drew is extremely helpful and knowledgeable and always does things for the best interest of his clients

DPA Law PC represented our company all the way from organization including setting up option plans through exit by sale to a public company. Drew is extremely helpful and knowledgeable and always does things for the best interest of his clients. We will use them again whenever given a chance.

\- Pawan Uberoy, Founder and CEO Evergreen, Inc

Drew really understood the needs of technology startups on both sides of the table

Drew Piunti and DPA represented the company I founded when we were acquired ... . Drew was invaluable in helping me through an exciting, but complex negotiation process. We had a wide array of investor and shareholder situations, and were under the gun to get a deal done as quickly as possible. Drew led us through the process and made it easy. He answered my questions, no matter how trivial (even on weekends), and took extra time out of his day to help me with the smallest of details. Drew really understood the needs of technology startups on both sides of the table. We're thrilled to know that we have a great deal with our acquiring company.

\- Ben Smith, SVP of Business Development, Vobile Inc., former Founder / CEO Blayze Inc.

DPA did not miss a beat and proved to be invaluable to my partners

After its expert handling of a commercial real estate LLC equity financing and its later successful exit from a project in Costa Rica, I recently asked DPA to assist on a business sale transaction. This was a very complicated partial sale of a controlling interest in an LP with attendant renegotiation of the management agreement, LP agreement and related purchase options. The purchaser and his counsel were as tough and savvy as any I have had the pleasure to do business with. DPA did not miss a beat and proved to be invaluable to my partners and me in this successful sale.

\- Matt McDaniel, Serial Entrepreneur and Investor

Drew Piunti deftly guided my relations with my new employer and a favorable mediated resolution of the litigation

When I left a company where I had worked for years as an independent contractor, that company sued me and my new employer in federal court asserting my general industry knowledge was proprietary to it. During the litigation DPA and Drew Piunti deftly guided my relations with my new employer and a favorable mediated resolution of the litigation. I found them to be knowledgeable, practical, and effective. Would hire them again - hopefully under other circumstances!

\- Keith Freedman, FreeForm Technologies, LLC

Drew was very dedicated, knowledgeable and PUT HIS HEART into my case

I had a huge shareholder/partner dispute, and was looking for a professional and ethical attorney to guide me out of this situation ... . After the consultation [with Drew Piunti] I decided to go with him without any hesitation. Before I met him I had consultations with other lawyers with whom I wasn't comfortable or confident of precisely what they could do for my case. ... It was a very long and stressful process but it is resolved favorably ... . Through the whole process Drew was very dedicated, knowledgeable and PUT HIS HEART into my case. If you are looking for an attorney who can actually take his/her time and try to resolve the problems on your behalf then you are in right place. Drew really cares for his clients and you will feel that and this separates him from other lawyers. I really appreciate his dedication and passion.

\- Jessie Kim, Founder and President, MJ12 Corp.

I was looking for things to get handled fast and Drew definitely came through for me

I first contacted Drew for help with a business partnership issue: separate from one partner and reorganize with a new partner as an LLC. I was looking for things to get handled fast and Drew definitely came through for me. He responded to my emails right away and did a great job of keeping me informed of my options along the way. I will definitely be using him in the future as well as recommending him to friends and colleagues.

\- Ayme Dickson, Managing Member, Jen’s Cakes LLC
