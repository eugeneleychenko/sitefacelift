# WHO WE ARE

![Sacks & Sacks](http://sacks-sacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/spacer.gif)

60 years

For over sixty years, Sacks & Sacks has been New York’s preeminent law firm in
obtaining compensation and damages for construction workers who were injured
on the job.

$1B+

Our team of lawyers has secured record-shattering verdicts for our clients,
including over two dozen verdicts and settlements in excess of $10 million.

1969

Our founding partners, Ira, Melvin and Stanley Sacks, wrote the amendments to
the New York Labor Law that were adopted by the Legislature in 1969 to greatly
expand the protections afforded to construction workers, and the firm has
worked tirelessly to continue to expand those rights through landmark verdicts
and appellate decisions obtained by our trial and appellate counsel.

We will continue to build on that foundation and to work tirelessly to ensure
that our clients and their families’ futures are secured.
