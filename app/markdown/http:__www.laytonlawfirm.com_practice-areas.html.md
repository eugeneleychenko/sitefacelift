Representing you is what we do. From small to mid-size businesses, from banks to painting contractors to non-profits, whatever complexion your business takes, Layton Law Firm represents your interests across a complex legal landscape.     From employment discrimination or harassment cases to wage and hour claims; from Department of Labor audits to confusing leaves-of-absence laws--whatever challenge you face, we address it head-on with clarity and concern.     And perhaps most importantly, we strive to mitigate all challenges through preventive advice. Nipping a problem in   the bud before it blossoms into a court case is always preferable. And so many cases can be dealt with long before litigation is necessary. The cost is significantly less, both monetarily and psychologically. The goal is to avoid litigation whenever possible, while aggressively defending management interests in court when and if the time comes.     And sometimes, the easiest and most cost effective method to address employment law issues is through seminars and consulting. An informed and educated management team can be the best way to protect your interests. We are happy to work with you in providing that ounce of prevention that eliminates the need for many pounds of cure.
