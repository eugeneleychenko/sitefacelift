## Who We Are

We are a comprehensive business law and M&A advisory firm. The term “Venture
Capital Law” is essentially synonymous with buy-side mergers and acquisitions
advisory services. Our expertise lies in sell side M&A. However, our scope
extends far beyond this.

We bring a multi-disciplinary approach to tackling the legal, financial, and
strategic needs of our clients. Our core areas of focus range from business
establishment, corporate governance, c-suite and board of directors services,
transactional matters, mergers and acquisitions, labor and employment issues,
taxation, equity and debt financing, and securities law.

## We operate at the intersection of law, finance, and strategy



## Our Approach: an Attorney-Client Partnership

Our approach to our clients goes well beyond what traditional law or
professional services firms provide. We partner with our clients and join them
on their entrepreneurial journey.

Legal, financial, and management challenges are the most common reasons
reasons startups fail. Our partnership minimizes these challenges and
maximizes our clients' chances for success.

We identify high character founders and develop them as we grow their idea and
build their company with them.
