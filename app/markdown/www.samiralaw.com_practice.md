## Family Law Litigation

## The goal of most family law matters is to stay out of court. For those cases that require Court intervention, whether it involves a full-scale divorce or something less, like limited child custody or spousal support issue, we are here to be your voice.

## ​

## Business and Employment Litigation

## In today's world, litigation is part of any business. As such, we assist our clients with business/commercial disputes and protecting their rights in the employment law arena.

## ​

## Business Organizations

## A business that is built to thrive must encompass a strong foundation and organization. If you are creating a new entity or are expanding an existing entity, we can assist with the legal structure of your business.

## ​

## Civil Litigation

## Litigation and trial work requires skill and experience.  We are driven by our clients' success.
