While many of our clients are executives or professionals, we work with a wide
variety of employees, at all levels of responsibility.

Although our practice is largely focused on individuals, we also advise not-
for-profits and small employers on compliance with employment laws, draft
those employers’ employment contracts and severance agreements, and represent
them in negotiations. We also perform in-depth neutral investigations of
internal complaints and offer employer-sponsored interactive training for
employees and management regarding their rights and responsibilities in the
workplace.

We serve as neutral mediators in employment matters in federal court and are
available to serve as private mediators.
