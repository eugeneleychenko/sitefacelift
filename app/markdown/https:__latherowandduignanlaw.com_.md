### **“I wanted to write and express my appreciation for your prompt and
skillful handling of the personal injury suit of (Mrs. F). You were also very
generous in setting your final fee. It is a pleasure for a lawyer to hear a
client speak as positively of her attorney as (she) speaks of you. Your
representation was exactly what I had hoped for when I referred her to your
office.”**

### “The hospital is rectifying the situation so that it will not occur in the
future. We deeply appreciate the time and effort that you have given to us.
Without your support nothing would have been done to improve the level of
service given to us at the hospital. Once again, it seems small but, a special
thank you from the bottom of our hearts.”

**S.P. & Family**
