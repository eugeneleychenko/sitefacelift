### Bankruptcy Law

In the United States, bankruptcy law offers a debtor, one who is unable to pay his creditors, a way to resolve his debts through the division of his assets among his creditors. This process allows the interests of all the creditors to be treated equally. Some bankruptcy procedures allow debtors to be discharged of all financial obligations even if creditors have not been fully paid. While other bankruptcy procedures allow a debtor to stay in business and use their revenue to pay off creditors over a period of time.
