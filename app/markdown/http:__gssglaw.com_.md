## About Garofalo, Schreiber, Storm & Grant, Chtd.

Garofalo, Schreiber, Storm & Grant, Chartered is a progressive law firm
serving the needs of employers and their insurance carriers in a civil
liability context. The firm’s size permits economical representation of
employers in more than 35 counties throughout the state of Illinois. Our staff
of experienced attorneys aggressively pursues the interests of our clients by
looking for fresh approaches and unique solutions to legal problems. Our
proven track record has earned us a place in Best’s Directory of Recommended
Insurance Attorneys and an “AV” rating by Martindale-Hubbell.

The depth of our expertise, the devotion of our staff, and our commitment to

When an employee is injured on the job, the employer must provide immediate
assistance including payment of compensation for lost time, medical expenses
and even permanent disability. With today’s rising costs, employers need to
protect their interests more than ever. Our attorneys have many years of
experience in navigating the complexities of the workers’ compensation system
at the settlement, trial and appellate levels with one singular focus: to
reduce employers’ costs. Whether we’re defending the largest multinational
manufacturing corporation or the smallest family business, we adapt our
strategies to maintain that singular focus on reducing your costs.
