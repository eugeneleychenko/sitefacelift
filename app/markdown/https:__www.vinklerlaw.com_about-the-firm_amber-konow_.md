Amber Konow is an associate trial attorney and while she primarily
concentrates her practice in medical malpractice and catastrophic injury
cases, she has considerable experience working on behalf of victims of nursing
home abuse and neglect and other types of personal injury and wrongful death
matters. Prior to joining Vinkler Law Offices, Amber practiced medical
malpractice and nursing home litigation at another prominent Plaintiff's
personal injury firm in Chicago. In all areas of her practice, she works
diligently in her pursuit for justice for her clients, leaving no stone
unturned. Amber prioritizes her relationships with her clients while guiding
them through the litigation process and understands the incredible life
changes that come with medical malpractice and catastrophic injury cases.
Amber has been recognized as an Illinois Super Lawyers Rising Star
consecutively since 2022, an honor bestowed on only 2.5% of the lawyers in
Illinois each year.

As a student at The John Marshall Law School (now known as UIC Law), Amber
externed with the Family Law & Domestic Violence Legal Clinic in Chicago,
helping impoverished clients handle landlord-tenant disputes under the
Violence Against Women Act and The Safe Homes Act. In addition to her
schoolwork, Amber worked as a full-time law clerk for a prominent medical
malpractice firm in Chicago while attending law school at night. Her
experience at this firm influenced her decision to continue to pursue justice
for victims of medical malpractice.

Amber currently resides in the South Suburbs of Chicago where she and her
husband are raising their two children. Amber is actively involved in her
community and church. Amber takes a special interest in learning and personal
development and is an active member of the Illinois State Bar Association,
Illinois Trial Lawyers Association, American Association for Justice, and the
Women's Bar Association of Illinois. Amber was published in the Summer 2021
Illinois Trial Lawyers Association Trial Journal with her article "Implied
Agency: Actual Agency, Circumstantially Proved - How to Negate a Doctor's
Independent Contractor Status." Amber also takes a special interest in the
personal development of her peers, as she has volunteered with UIC Law's
mentoring program every year since 2019.
