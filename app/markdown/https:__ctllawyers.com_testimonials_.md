_“If you did not win it for us, we would be finished. It would be over.”_

**Tommy H.**



_“If you were on the other side, I think you would have beaten us.”_

_“You set the tone from the first couple of questions in the deposition. You
were highly aggressive. You got us an amazing settlement. If I had a future
need, I would absolutely call you.”_

**Kirk R., CEO**



_“William Clayton filed a case for me as a commercial Landlord against a
Tenant. He got us paid all of the rent that was owed, interest, and all of our
attorney’s fees. The outcome could not be better.”_
