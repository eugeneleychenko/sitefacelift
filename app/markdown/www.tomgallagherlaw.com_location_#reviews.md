If you need a “ Closer”, go see Troy. Troy has been one of the best attorneys I have ever worked with. I don’t typically give reviews but after the last case Troy helped me settle out of court, I won’t hesitate to use Troy again! Thanks for all you do Troy !

I left a voicemail for Tom late Sunday evening and received a phone call first thing the next morning.

Tom was very quick to reply to any questions I had, and if he was caught up in a meeting, he was sure to return my call promptly.

Tom provided sound and logical advice, during a very stressful and uncertain time. At times I asked him to be more aggressive and was often met with the pros and cons of that decision, allowing me to understand the approach and thought process behind his strategy.

Ultimately he provided options for several paths for us to take, worked swiftly, and got us where we needed to be.

He reached out several times to check on my sanity and make sure I was good.

As someone with very high expectations, I would highly recommend his services. He provided expertise that proved to be successful, and also took the time to make sure I was emotionally solid.

Tom assisted with me with a 50% / 50% ownership conflict.

What was thought to be a simple breach of contract turned into a nightmare. Through their tenacity and their deep knowledge of the law, we were successful. There is no reason to look any further as you will not get any better representation than this firm. I highly recommend them and strongly suggest that if you are considering starting a business or are already managing one, this firm will guide you, avoiding the troubled waters businesses sometimes find themselves in.

Johnny Nitti helped us with our estate plan. He was very meticulous while drafting the plan and spent enough time to explain the details to us. He filed the deed with county recorder and paid for the fees himself. Overall, Johnny did a great job and we definitely plan to work with him in the future for any updates to our EP.

Yelpers, Hopefully you will never need an attorney but if you ever run into a legal entitlement, you must see Troy Krich.

Troy is my legal counsel and is one of the best attorney you will ever come across! Troy is highly ethical, knows his stuff and will win a case !

Troy is also excellent at negotiating for a settlement for you.

Thank you Troy for everything! Professional, prompt, and smooth handling of my case. I will be recommending to anyone that is in need of a lawyer.

incorporated with gallagher krich and they took care of everything at about the same cost as these stupid “no-lawyer” sites. i want a real lawyer because they also have value-added-service and additional advice on the structure of business and the way the law functions around business.

We received a letter from an attorney representing an ex employee from years ago. This letter couldn’t have come at a worse time for our family. Although the ex-employee had no substance in their case and this was mostly a nuisance, we felt very vulnerable and unprepared. I reached out to a few lawyers for a quote and their retainer fees alone were deal breakers. When I reached Thomas Gallagher, he approached my case from a completely different angle and walked me through the many small steps we would take to get through this issue. Within the first conversation I felt like I had a plan of attack, an attorney I could trust, and that our family was protected. Our case ended up never going to court. In fact, Thomas was able to resolve the entire issue within a week. I am extremely happy with the results from this potential lawsuit, but even happier knowing my family and business is now protected by a lawyer than can get the job done.

Look no further. I came to Tom Gallagher with what I thought to be a simple contract law breach. It was because of the tenancy and knowledge of the law that Tom brought to the table and is the reason that we prevailed and I was able to recoup the losses I had recognized. I cannot give a higher recommendation for this group. It is not just contract law either. I would recommend this group for any of your potential legal issues. Their excellent knowledge of the law and their skills will help to prevent potential issues. Use them for all your personal or cooperate needs. You will not be disappointed.

Mr. Gallagher provided outstanding legal feedback, and was exceptionally helpful and informative, in regards to thouroughly evaluating my case details over the phone. The free consultation I received from Tom exceeded my expectations, as Mr. Gallagher went above the extent of what you’d normally hear from other attorneys. Thanks!

As a new entrepreneur with limited contract experience it was a pleasure working with Mr. Gallagher and his colleague Mr. Krich. From the very beginning of contract negotiation to a signed agreement, Tom & Troy provided timely responses to millions of questions while guiding me in the right direction. I’m looking forward to working with Mr. Gallagher on future contracts.

I had an insurance case that had dragged on for many months, and as soon as it got turned over to Tom Gallagher it was closed outside of court within 10 days. He charged a fair fee for the work and got the job done fast which allowed me to recover almost all of my money. I’d definitely recommend him to anyone seeking his services.
