# About LOKK Legal

LOKK LEGAL provides real estate and business owners with high-quality services.

LOKK LEGAL was founded on the belief that the small to medium business and the indivdual entrepreneur are the backbone of the US Economy. Everyday there are hundreds of thousands of small businesses in the US, many of which are not adequately represented in their day-to-day dealings or transactions.

This lack of quality representation is causing unnecessary and undue legal exposure to these hard working individuals. Below are just a few of the problems that small businesses and individual entrepreneurs who do not have proper legal representation continually run into.

WE CAN PREVENT CLAIMS FOR:

  * Breach of Contract
  * Breach of Lease
  * Breach of Partnership
  * Breach of Oral Agreement
  * Breach of Purchase Agreement
  * Piercing the Corporate Veil
  * Attorneys Fees
  * Costs
  * Failure to have a Proper Legal Entity



LOKK LEGAL has set out to cure this injustice by planning ahead and providing high-quality real estate services for its clients.

LOKK LEGAL understands that small businesses do not generally have exorbitantly large expense accounts or limitless discretionary funds.

LOKK LEGAL believes that with proper legal planning and preparation, that a small business can prevent unnecessary legal expense, exposure, headaches, and most importantly, grow.

Angela Ness and Tabitha did such an expectional job. Communication was clear and consise, meetings occured on time. Legal advice and knowledge of the subject matter was excellent. I know I received excellent value for my money. Best legal experience in the last 30 years. I highly recommend their services.

Lokk Legal is a very professional law firm. I called them in a panic not knowing what to do and they were there for me every step of the way. I am very grateful for the help I received from Angela and Tabitha, the service they provided me exceeded my expectations, they explained everything, always calling when they said they would and helped me figure out the best solution for my problem, at the end my case was thrown out because of all their hard work. I highly recommend them. If you need an attorney these are the girls for you.

I've worked with Lokk Legal twice and had two positive outcomes from the experiences. Angela Ness was my lawyer both times and her professionalism and knowledge of the law for my cases was spot on. I couldn't have asked for better experiences and I am happy to refer her to anyone who needs legal counsel. Tabitha Darden, who assists Ms. Ness, was always helpful and on top of everything as well. I am grateful that I found them and you will be too!

Our Small business was very pleased with the work from Lokk Legal in creating a Business Contract and agreement for us.Not only was there a pre-meeting to get a proper understanding, but they patiently walked me through each section so that i could clearly understand how my business can benefit and educate our onboarding partners.I highly recommend this team for any small business that needs assistance in contract/agreement creation.

I didn't trust lawyers and feared the nickel and diming hourly rates. That was my experience... until I met Koorosh. He is someone that puts your needs first and works to ensure you get a not only what was requested, but the highest quality product possible. How refreshing. :)

I am looking to set up a small photography business and took Koorosh up on the free consultation. He could not have been more knowledgable and relieved me of so much anxiety by listening to my needs, preferences, and then knowing EXACTLY everything that would need to be done to legitimize my business. There was no pressure to have to do anything that day and as someone that really dislikes the aggressive salesman, this made my experience that much better and more enjoyable. I look forward to working with Koorosh to generate multiple types of contracts needed for my business; a worthwhile investment. Thank you!! (Even if you're on the fence, just start with the free consultation. You'll see what I'm talking about!)

Great Law firm. Very experienced in Transactional Real Estate Law. Every Commercial buyer or seller needs Koorosh on their side.

The BEST Business Attorney around. I just used LOKK Legal to change my small business from a Sole Proprietorship to an LLC and the process could not have been any smoother! Not to mention the Stunning view of the San Diego Harbor while you sit in his office. I highly recommend Koorosh and his legal team for any Business or Real Estate law needs!

Attorney Koorosh Khashayar is very professional and knowledgeable in his field. I know he cares for his clients, as I have referred clients to him and they have only positive things to say about him and this firm. The ability to keep so many personalities happy deserves 5 stars!

As many of the previous reviews have already said, Lokk Legal is a MUST for any business and business owner. There are so many ways you need to be protected, especially when getting into a contract with another individual or company. Why not get a professional lawyer to help out. Lokk Legal is a huge asset. Their knowledge is invaluable as well as very affordable.You can't afford not to have them help you!

The level of attention to detail as well as delivering value to you is outstanding. Koorosh's counsel is right on point, finding that delicate balance between protecting your interests and getting the deal done. He is a great resource for translating 'legalese' into something you can understand and I strongly recommend LOKK Legal.
