###### Each Case is Unique

We believe that each case is unique. There is no cookie cutter strategy when
it comes to how cases should be litigated. We work with each and every single
client to help them understand what they are facing - and to prepare for all
possible outcomes. Above all, our #1 objective is to get all charges
dismissed, or reduced.

We offer an initial consultation to prospective clients over the phone, or in
person at one of our locations. Regardless of how complex your case is, we can
help. Our New York City criminal law firm is selective about the number of
clients we service each month. We only take on clients who we passionately
believe we can help. Our goal is to get each client the best results possible,
and to provide the best service possible.

That's one of the reasons why our client's refer us to their friends and loved
ones. During your initial consultation, you can ask us anything. We can
discuss what your case is about, what type of punishments you face, and how
you can fight the accusations. Typically, we look at how to get the case
dismissed, or how we can get a plea deal that results in an acceptable
outcome. Our New York criminal defense lawyers are always available day or
night to answer your questions, or any questions your loved ones have.
